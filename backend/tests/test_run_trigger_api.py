"""Tests for `POST /websites/{id}/runs` — the manual run trigger and its per-user caps.

Its own file rather than an addition to `tests/test_runs_api.py`, because this is the only
suite in the backend that needs BOTH a real Postgres AND a real Redis. Keeping it separate
means `test_runs_api.py`'s two read endpoints keep exercising and passing purely off
`websites_db` — they have never depended on Redis and should not start skipping (or worse,
silently passing for the wrong reason) the day someone's local Redis container is down.

Every test drives the real application (`app.main.app`) exactly as `test_runs_api.py` and
`test_websites_api.py` do, with one addition: `queue_override` (or one of its two sibling
fixtures) swaps `app.api.routers.runs.require_queue_pool` for something under this test's
control. Overriding THAT function rather than `app.api.deps.get_arq_pool` is deliberate —
`require_queue_pool`'s own docstring explains why it calls `get_arq_pool()` from inside its
own `try` instead of declaring it as a sub-dependency, and the only way a test can prove that
wiring is real (rather than merely plausible) is to exercise `require_queue_pool` itself,
never a stand-in for the function one layer below it.

Seeding uses `conftest.seed_run` / `conftest.seed_website` directly against the database,
never through the API — the same reasoning `test_websites_api.py`'s module docstring gives:
a test that built its own fixtures by POSTing would not be able to tell "the trigger endpoint
is wrong" apart from "the thing I seeded with is wrong".
