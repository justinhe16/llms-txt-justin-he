"""Tests for PER-166's retry policy: which failures earn another attempt, which do not, and
what the `runs` row says afterwards.

**Driven through `app.worker.jobs.crawl_task`, not through `CrawlService` directly**, because
half of what this ticket added lives in the seam between them: the service decides that an
attempt was transient, and the job turns that into `arq.worker.Retry`. A test that called the
service would prove the classification and miss the translation, which is the part a queue
actually acts on.

Real Postgres, same as `tests/test_crawl_task.py` and for the same reason its module docstring
gives: every website here is seeded with an IP literal, never a hostname, so `internals/
ssrf.py`'s real `getaddrinfo` has nothing to resolve and the autouse `_forbid_real_network`
fixture is never asked to stop a DNS lookup it cannot see. `8.8.8.8` is the public literal;
`127.0.0.1` is the one deliberately used to make `validate_url` refuse.

**Every assertion is on the `runs` row, not on what a function returned.** `crawl_task`
answering `"no outcome"` says nothing about whether the run is recoverable — `pending`,
`processing`, and `failed` all produce that same string — and "no run is ever left
`processing`" is a claim about the database.

`runs.attempts` is seeded directly where a test needs a run part-way through its budget. The
column is only ever written by `claim_pending`, so the alternative would be running two real
crawls to reach the third, which would make every one of these tests a test of the two
attempts it did not care about.

    `arq.worker.Worker.run_job` runs each job as `await asyncio.wait_for(task, timeout_s)` and
    retries only on `Retry`, `RetryJob`, and `CancelledError`. When the JOB TIMEOUT is what
    cancels, `wait_for` converts the outcome into `TimeoutError` at its own call site once the
    coroutine has finished unwinding — and `TimeoutError` is not in that set, so arq records
    the job as failed and never redelivers it. A deploy's SIGTERM is the opposite case: it
    cancels `run_job`'s own frame, arq really does see `CancelledError`, and the job is
    re-queued.

    That distinction is load-bearing for this ticket and completely invisible from inside
    `execute_run`, which sees `CancelledError` either way. It is also not something to take on
    faith from a changelog: it depends on `asyncio.wait_for`'s unwinding semantics AND on
    arq's exception triage, either of which could change under a dependency bump. So it is
    pinned here against a real `Worker` in burst mode.

    **The cleanup assertion is the half that matters for correctness.** Whatever arq decides
    afterwards, the coroutine's cancellation handler must run to completion — that is what
    writes the run back to `pending`, and a version of `asyncio` or `arq` that killed the task
    before its `except` block finished would silently strand every cancelled run. Asserting
