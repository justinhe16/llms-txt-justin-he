"""Tests for `app.features.crawl.schemas` — specifically the one property that matters more
than any single field's value: `CrawledPage`'s FIELD ORDER.

`CrawledPage` is a plain dataclass with no keyword-only marker on its fields, so a caller
using positional construction silently reorders arguments into the wrong parameters the
moment a field is inserted anywhere but the end — no `TypeError`, just a `CrawledPage` with
its values quietly transposed. `content_bytes`'s own docstring documents that hazard, and
`description`, `markdown`, `is_empty` (PER-177), and `blocked_reason` (this repo's own
WAF-detection ticket) repeat the same promise about their own position. This file is the
guard that turns a violation of that promise into a test failure rather than a silent
misassignment the next time someone edits this dataclass.
