"""Tests for `app.features.crawl.internals.fetcher` — the one bounded, redirect-following,

autouse `_forbid_real_network` fixture (tests/conftest.py), and every fetch injects a fake
`Resolver` instead of touching real DNS. That combination is what turns "no socket was
opened for the second hop" from an assumption into something this suite can actually
measure: the assertion is a call count on the transport handler, not an absence of a log
