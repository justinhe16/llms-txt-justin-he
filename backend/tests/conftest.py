"""Shared pytest fixtures.

Four families of fixtures live here: an in-process HTTP client, which is all a shallow
`/health` needs; for tests that exercise real Postgres, like `tests/test_transaction.py`, a
session-scoped pool and a function-scoped, always-rolled-back connection; for
`tests/test_jwks.py` and `tests/test_auth_dependencies.py`, a kit for generating throwaway
signing keys and standing up a fake JWKS endpoint that counts genuine HTTP requests; and —
at the bottom of this file — signed-in API clients for two different users, which is what
lets a feature suite assert both halves of the authorization contract (ARCHITECTURE.md §4)
against the real application.
