"""Tests for app.features.websites.internals.url_normalize.

Pure-function tests, no database and no HTTP: this module is the one place the "what counts
as the same website" rule is written down, and it is the crawler's future dependency as much
as it is `POST /websites`'s. `tests/test_websites_api.py` covers the same function reached
through the API, including the ticket's literal acceptance criterion.
