"""Tests for the websites API: `POST`, `GET`, `GET /{id}`, and `DELETE /websites`.

Every test here drives the real application (`app.main.app`) over a real Postgres, with a
real signed JWT — see the "signed-in API clients" section of `conftest.py`. Nothing about
authentication or authorization is stubbed, because the two claims this feature has to make
are exactly the ones a stub would paper over:

* **Any signed-in user reads everything.** `test_listing_returns_other_users_websites` and
  `test_a_non_owner_can_read_a_website_by_id` are the tests that fail the day someone adds a
  well-meaning `WHERE user_id = $1` to the reader. They are the most valuable tests in this
  file.
* **Only the owner writes.** `test_deleting_another_users_website_is_403_and_the_row_survives`
  checks both halves — the status code *and* that the row is still there afterwards. A 403
  that had already deleted the row would pass a status-only assertion.

Row cleanup is handled by the `websites_db` fixture, which deletes only rows owned by this
suite's two fake users. So **assert containment, never equality**, on the list endpoint: the
database may legitimately hold other rows, and a `len(body) == 2` assertion would be green
in CI and red on a developer's machine.
