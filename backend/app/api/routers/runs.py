"""HTTP handlers for `/websites/{id}/runs`, `/runs/{id}`, `/runs/{id}/llms.txt`,
`/runs/{id}/llms-full.txt`, and `/websites/{id}/stats`. Thin by contract (ARCHITECTURE.md
§3.2).

Every handler below parses its input, calls exactly one service method, and returns the
result. There is no `if`, no `for`, no SQL, and no second service call anywhere in this
file. The one thing that looks like logic — `parse_cursor` — is a router-level input
*parser*, the same role `id: UUID` already plays for a path parameter: it turns a value
FastAPI cannot validate declaratively (an opaque, feature-owned cursor format) into either
a typed `RunCursor` or a `422`, before any service method runs. It contains no business
rule about runs — it is `decode_cursor` plus one `try`/`except` translating its one
exception type into HTTP. `WindowQuery`, `get_website_stats`'s query parameter, needs no
such parser: `StatsWindowName` is a `Literal`, so FastAPI itself turns an unrecognized
`?window=` into a `422` declaratively. `_artifact_response`, below the two artifact
handlers, is a second router-level *presentation* helper of the same kind — it decides no
business rule about runs either, only how a `RunArtifact` becomes an HTTP response.

**Authentication vs. authorization, visible in the signatures — same pattern as
`websites.py`.** Every handler takes `CurrentUserId`, so every endpoint is `401` without a
valid token. `trigger_run` is the one handler that passes that id on to its service, because
it is the one WRITE in this router and writes are ownership-checked — `RunService.trigger_run`
hands it straight to `require_owner` (ARCHITECTURE.md §4.2). The five reads — `list_runs`,
`get_run`, `get_run_llms_txt`, `get_run_llms_full_txt`, and `get_website_stats` — all still
take `CurrentUserId` purely to require a token and deliberately never thread it any further,
because reads in this codebase are unscoped by caller (ARCHITECTURE.md §4.1): any signed-in
user may read any website's run history, any run's full detail including its `llms_txt`, any
run's two generated artifacts (PER-181), and any website's run statistics. That asymmetry is
the authorization contract in miniature, and it is what makes this feature's tests for "a
non-owner can read this, but cannot trigger this" meaningful rather than vacuous.

`GET /websites/{id}/stats` lives here rather than in a new `stats` feature module because
the aggregate it runs reads exactly one table, `runs`, which this feature already owns —
see `app.features.runs.service.RunService.get_website_stats` for the full reasoning.

**`get_run_llms_txt` and `get_run_llms_full_txt` return a `Response`, not a Pydantic model,
and that is intentional rather than a crack in "routers are thin."** Each handler is still
exactly one call to one service method — `return _artifact_response(await
service.get_llms_txt(id))` — with the response-shaping factored into the one helper both
share, the same way `parse_cursor` factors out the one piece of input-shaping this router
does. See `_artifact_response`'s own docstring for the `PlainTextResponse` and
`Content-Disposition` details, and Decision C of PER-181's implementation notes for why
`response_class=PlainTextResponse` is what makes `openapi.json` declare `text/plain` here
instead of an empty `application/json` schema.

**What these two routes do NOT do, on purpose: `Content-Disposition` reaches a browser only
when nothing sits between it and FastAPI.** `frontend/app/api/[...path]/route.ts`'s BFF proxy
(ARCHITECTURE.md §8.1) forwards only `content-type` from the upstream response today, so the
header these two handlers set is currently dropped before it reaches the browser. That gap is
deliberate, documented, and owned by the frontend download ticket that wires a UI up to these
routes — it is not fixed here.

    to decide what to do about it — the first one to exist should catch this and answer
    503." `POST /websites/{id}/runs` is that first route, which is also why this function
    lives here and not in `app.api.deps`, which stays generic (ARCHITECTURE.md §3.1's
    reasoning for `get_website_service` living beside its own routes applies identically

    depend on it there.

    **Must call `get_arq_pool()` inside this function's own `try`, never take it as a

    `except` lives — ever ran, surfacing as an unhandled `500` instead of the `503` this

    without Redis on purpose (`app.main.lifespan`), and `GET /runs/{id}` /
    `GET /websites/{id}/runs` must keep answering while Redis is down — a queue outage is
    not a database outage. That is also why the queue is a per-ROUTE dependency here rather
    than a constructor argument on `RunService`: `get_run_service` above is shared by both
    reads and this one write, and threading a queue pool through its constructor would make
    every read's service construction depend on Redis being reachable — exactly the
