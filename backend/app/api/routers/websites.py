"""HTTP handlers for `/websites`. Thin by contract (ARCHITECTURE.md §3.2).

Every handler below parses its input, calls exactly one service method, and returns the
result. There is no `if`, no `for`, no SQL, and no second service call anywhere in this
file, and there should never be — the moment a handler needs one of those, the logic belongs
in `WebsiteService`.

**Authentication vs. authorization, visible in the signatures.** Every handler takes
`CurrentUserId`, so every endpoint is `401` without a valid token. `delete_website` and, as
of PER-194, `update_website` pass that id on to the service, because only writes care who is
asking (ARCHITECTURE.md §4). `list_websites` and `get_website` take the dependency purely to
require a token and then deliberately ignore it — reads are authenticated and unscoped, and
a `user_id` argument threaded into a read service method is how that rule gets broken.
