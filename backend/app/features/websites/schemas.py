"""Request and response DTOs for the websites feature.

These are shapes, not logic (ARCHITECTURE.md §3.1). The one thing that looks like an
exception is `CreateWebsiteRequest`'s validator, and it is the opposite: it delegates every
rule to `internals.url_normalize`, so that the same function decides what a valid URL is for
the HTTP boundary, for the service, and — later — for the crawler.

**Why `CreateWebsiteRequest` validates but does not carry the normalized result.**
`normalize_url` gets called twice for one `POST`: once here, for its exception (pydantic
turns a `ValueError` into FastAPI's native `422`, so the router needs no `try`), and once in
the service, for the `origin` it needs to dedupe against. The obvious "optimization" is to
stash the `NormalizedUrl` on this model in a `model_validator` and let the service read it
back — and that is exactly what §3.1's "schemas must never contain logic" rules out: it
turns a DTO into a carrier of derived state, and makes the service's behaviour depend on
whether its input came through pydantic or was constructed directly in a test.
`normalize_url` is pure, allocation-light, and called once per `POST /websites`; the second
call costs microseconds and buys a layer boundary that stays honest.
