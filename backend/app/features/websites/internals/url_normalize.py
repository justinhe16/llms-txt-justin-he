"""URL validation and origin normalization — the one implementation, deliberately shared.

This module lives in `websites/internals/` because `websites` is the feature that needs it
first, but it is written to be the ONLY place this logic ever exists. The crawler
milestone (ARCHITECTURE.md §3.4) has to resolve relative links against a page's origin,
which is the same computation; two implementations of "what is this URL's origin" would
diverge the first time one of them learned about default ports and the other did not. If a
second feature needs it, move this module to a shared location and update both imports —
do not copy it.

**What normalization is for.** `websites` has a `UNIQUE (user_id, origin)` constraint
(db/schema.prisma), so `origin` is the dedupe key: `https://Example.com:443/pricing?ref=x`
and `https://example.com/` are the same site and must produce the same `origin`. `url`
keeps whatever the user actually typed, because it is what gets shown back to them and
what makes "why did it dedupe against that?" answerable.

**Deliberately pure.** No I/O, no DNS lookup, no HTTP request, no database access. This
function cannot tell you whether a host exists — only whether the string is a well-formed
absolute `http`/`https` URL and what its origin is. Reachability is the crawler's problem.

**The normalization rules**, and the reasoning behind each:

| Input | Origin | Why |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `https://EXAMPLE.com` | `https://example.com` | Host is case-insensitive (RFC 3986 §3.2.2) |
| `https://example.com:443` | `https://example.com` | Default port for the scheme is redundant |
| `http://example.com:80` | `http://example.com` | Same, for `http` |
| `https://example.com:8443` | `https://example.com:8443` | A non-default port is identity |
| `https://example.com/a/b/` | `https://example.com` | An origin has no path, slash included |
| `https://example.com?q=1#f` | `https://example.com` | Query and fragment are per-request |
| `https://www.example.com` | `https://example.com` | **A leading `www.` is STRIPPED** — see below |

**Why a leading `www.` is stripped from the ORIGIN — and this reverses an earlier decision
in this module, deliberately.** The paragraph that stood here argued the opposite: that the
two names can serve different content, so folding them would "silently generate one site's
`llms.txt` from another site's pages." The risk it named is real; what it got wrong is that
folding the ORIGIN does not fold the CRAWL.

`origin` is a dedupe key and nothing else. `url` is what
`app.features.crawl.service` actually fetches, and `url` keeps the host exactly as the user
typed it — so a run against a registered `https://www.example.com` fetches `www`, start to
finish, whatever its apex would have served. No artifact is ever built from a mix of the two.

What the old rule cost instead was ordinary and constant: an apex that redirects to `www` is
the most common configuration on the web, so registering `example.com` and
`www.example.com` produced two rows, two schedules, two crawl histories, and two `llms.txt`
files describing byte-for-byte the same pages. Deduping that is the whole point of having a
dedupe key.

The residue is narrow and visible rather than silent: a user who registers both spellings
gets a `409` naming the website that already exists (`app.features.websites.service`), whose
`url` — the host that will actually be crawled — is right there in the response.

**Rows written before this change keep their `www.` origins, and no migration collapses
them.** Normalization runs at write time, so a website registered as `www.example.com`
yesterday still has `origin = "https://www.example.com"` and will not dedupe against an
`example.com` registered today. That is deliberate rather than deferred work: the collapse
cannot be done as a plain `UPDATE`, because a user holding BOTH spellings has two rows that
would become one `origin` under a `UNIQUE (user_id, origin)` index, and choosing which row's
runs, schedule, and history survive is a product decision rather than a data-migration one.
The cost of leaving them is one stale duplicate for a user who already had two.

**What is rejected**, all with `UrlValidationError` (which the request schema turns into a
`422`, see `app.features.websites.schemas`):

- Anything that is not an absolute `http`/`https` URL — `ftp://`, `file://`, `javascript:`,
  a bare `example.com`, `/relative/path`, `//protocol-relative`, or plain garbage.
- **Credentials in the URL** (`https://user:pass@example.com`). Rejected rather than
  stripped: a credentialed URL is a secret (ARCHITECTURE.md §9.1), and this one would be
  persisted in `websites.url`, echoed back in API responses, and eventually handed to the
  crawler. Silently stripping it would store the sanitized copy and leave the user thinking
  their credentials were being used; rejecting says what happened.
- Anything longer than `MAX_URL_LENGTH`.
- A malformed host: whitespace, control characters, an empty label, an out-of-range port.
