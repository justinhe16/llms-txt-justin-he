"""Every `SELECT` for the websites feature. No writes, ever (ARCHITECTURE.md §3.1).

**READS IN THIS FILE ARE INTENTIONALLY NOT SCOPED TO THE CALLER. DO NOT ADD
`WHERE user_id = $1` TO `list_all`, `list_all_with_latest_run`, OR `get_by_id`.**

This is the single easiest rule in this project to break by being helpful (ARCHITECTURE.md
§4.1). This application is **not multi-tenant**: there is one flat pool of websites, and
browsing every user's sites — including the `llms.txt` they generated — is the product, not
a leak. An owner filter added here for "security hygiene" would pass every test that only
ever signs in as one user, look like an improvement in review, and silently delete the main
feature.

The one method that does take a `user_id` is `get_by_user_and_origin`, and that is the
case §4.1 explicitly blesses: "A reader may still accept a `user_id` as a query argument for
a genuinely user-filtered feature... What is prohibited is applying that filter to the
general read path as an implicit security measure." It exists because
`UNIQUE (user_id, origin)` is a *dedupe* key — one user may not add the same site twice,
two users may each add it — so the duplicate lookup is per-user by definition, not for
protection.

**Why the list query is one statement.** `GET /websites?include=latest_run` backs the main
table. Folding in each website's most recent run with a query per row is the classic N+1,
and it is felt immediately here because the page renders every website the installation has.
`_LIST_WITH_LATEST_RUN` uses a `LEFT JOIN LATERAL ... LIMIT 1`, so the query count is one,
independently of how many websites exist. `tests/test_websites_api.py` measures that rather
than assuming it.

`LATERAL` over `DISTINCT ON` (the ticket offers either): both are one statement and both ride
the `runs(website_id, started_at DESC)` index from db/schema.prisma, but `DISTINCT ON`
requires the outer `ORDER BY` to lead with `website_id`, which collides with this endpoint's
"most recently active first" ordering and would need a wrapping subquery to fix.
