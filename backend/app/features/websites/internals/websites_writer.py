"""Every `INSERT`/`UPDATE`/`DELETE` for the websites feature (ARCHITECTURE.md §3.1).

**This writer never commits, never rolls back, and never opens a transaction.** It executes
one statement against whatever it was constructed with and returns. The unit of work belongs
to `transaction()` in the service (ARCHITECTURE.md §5), which is what lets two writer calls
share one transaction: neither assumes it owns the connection it is running on.

Consequently a `WebsitesWriter` is built *inside* a service's `transaction()` block, from
the `Connection` that block yields:

```python
async with transaction(self._pool) as tx:
    await WebsitesWriter(tx).delete(website_id)
```

That is the mechanism `app.infrastructure.db.base_repository` provides ("pass the
`Connection` yielded by `transaction()` instead of the pool, and every reader/writer
constructed with it participates in that same unit of work"). ARCHITECTURE.md §4.2/§5 sketch
it as `self._writer.delete(tx, ...)`; those snippets predate the base classes and are
illustrative about *where the boundary is*, which is identical either way — the same
divergence `app/infrastructure/db/transaction.py`'s docstring already records for
`self.transaction()`.

**No ownership check happens here.** A writer cannot know whether the caller is allowed to
write; by the time one of these methods runs, the service has already fetched the resource
and called `require_owner`. Putting a `user_id` predicate in the `DELETE` below would be a
second, silently-diverging enforcement point — and one that answers "0 rows deleted" where
the contract says `403`.
