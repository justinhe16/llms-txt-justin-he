"""The artifacts a run publishes: `llms.txt` (a curated index) and `llms-full.txt` (the
corpus behind it). Pure functions — no network, no clock, no I/O, nothing that reads a
setting.

**This module was THE STUB SEAM, and is no longer one.** ARCHITECTURE.md §3.4 and CLAUDE.md
#9 held everything downstream of a fetched page behind `generate_llms_txt(pages, *, site_url)`
while that pipeline was undesigned, and until PER-179 this function honoured that by
returning an H1, a blockquote disclaiming itself as provisional, and one bullet per fetched
URL. The pipeline is designed now and this module implements it. What the old docstring
forbade has NOT become permitted wholesale, though — the boundary moved rather than vanished:

* **Deciding which fetched pages belong in the artifact, how they are grouped, and how they
  are labelled is now this module's job.** That is the design that landed, and it lives here,
  in one file, rather than scattered through `app.features.crawl.service` or
  `internals/crawler.py`.
* **Calling a model is still out of scope, and not merely "not yet implemented".** Everything
  below produces a complete, useful artifact with no model involved, on purpose: when
  summarization does land it is a layer *above* this one, and this module stays the fallback
  that runs when that feature's flag is off or its API call fails. A function that only works
  when an external service answers is not a fallback. Nothing here may grow a network call,
  and nothing here may become conditional on one having happened.

**Deterministic regardless of fetch order.** `internals/crawler.py`'s frontier fetches race
each other, so the order pages arrive in `CrawlResult.pages` is not reproducible between two
runs of the same crawl. Every value derived below — the project name, the origin, the section
each page lands in, the order of bullets within a section, and the order page bodies appear
in `llms-full.txt` — is computed from the pages sorted by URL first, and every ordering
decision falls back to a total tie-break. Both artifacts are therefore pure functions of
*which* pages were fetched, never of the order they finished in. Sorting happens HERE, once,
rather than at the call site, so every caller gets that guarantee for free and no future
caller can forget to. `internals/url_ranking.py`'s `select_urls` makes the same promise for
the upstream half (ARCHITECTURE.md §3.4).

## Four public functions where the ticket named two

`generate_llms_txt` and `generate_llms_full_txt` are the artifacts, and both return `str`
exactly as ARCHITECTURE.md §3.4 pins the seam's shape. But `runs.stats` has to record two
numbers only this module can know: how many links the index actually lists
(`links_emitted`, which stopped meaning "one per fetched page" the moment `is_empty` pages
began being skipped) and how many page bodies the caps below cut (`full_txt_truncated`).
Widening either generator's return type to carry them would change the seam's signature;
re-deriving them in `app.features.crawl.service` would put this module's skip rule and cap
arithmetic in a second place, free to drift from the artifact it claims to describe — the
exact failure `internals/run_stats.py` warns about when it says `links_emitted` is "exactly
as accurate as the artifact it describes".

So the counts are their own functions, `count_indexed_pages` and
`count_full_txt_truncations`, and each shares its whole implementation with the generator it
describes (`_index_entries` and `_plan_full_txt` respectively) rather than reimplementing it.
The cost is that a caller wanting both an artifact and its count computes the selection
twice. That is deliberate and bounded: the selection is a sort and a filter, and
`_plan_full_txt`'s worst case is capped at `MAX_FULL_TEXT_BYTES` by construction. Paying it
buys the property that a count and the artifact it counts cannot disagree, because there is
only one implementation of each for them to disagree about. Do not "optimize" this into a
cache or shared mutable state; a pure function that is called twice is the cheap problem
here.

codebase is).

Bytes, not characters, because the number that matters is how much of a Postgres `text`
column and how much of a worker's memory this consumes, and a character is not a fixed amount
of either — a page of CJK prose averages three bytes per character, so a character budget
would permit roughly three times the column it advertises. Bounded independently of the
crawl's own `crawl_max_bytes` setting on purpose — and NOT read from settings here, which is

the cap that actually protects `runs.llms_full_txt`, and it is enforced at a PAGE BOUNDARY
(see `_plan_full_txt`), never mid-page.

A backstop rather than the common path: at today's defaults this binds only if nearly every
page in a run is at its own cap.

**`llms.txt` deliberately gets no equivalent cap**, and the asymmetry is reasoned rather than
an omission. A bullet is a bounded title (`MAX_TEXT_CHARS`), a bounded description (likewise)
and a URL, repeated at most `crawl_max_pages` times — so the index's size is bounded by the
page count times the longest URL in the run, which is kilobytes for any site a crawler
actually meets. The URL is the one part that is NOT bounded here, and deliberately so: a
truncated URL is a broken link, which is strictly worse than a long one, and dropping bullets
to hit a byte target would defeat the point of an index. If a pathological run ever makes

with an eight-megabyte `<title>` produces an eight-megabyte `llms-full.txt` header before the
first page section is even considered, and `MAX_FULL_TEXT_BYTES` never gets a say; the index,
which has no size cap of its own precisely because bullets were assumed to be small, has the
same hole through a long description. `internals/extract.py` bounds neither, and should not
have to — it reports what the document said, and what is safe to inline into a column is this
module's question.

500 characters is far past any real value and still trivially bounded: a `<title>` is

    `is_empty` is the oldest and the one ARCHITECTURE.md §3.4 calls out by name: a bullet
    naming a URL with no title and no description tells a reader nothing a sitemap would not.
    The other two are newer and share a justification — **an artifact that claims to index
    `origin` must not list a page that is not a readable page of `origin`**:

    * **Not a 2xx.** A `404`, `429` or `5xx` response is a real document with a real
      `<title>`, which is exactly why it has to be excluded explicitly rather than caught by
      `is_empty`. Left in, a rate-limited page enters the index as `- [Too Many Requests](…)`.
    * **Not on `origin`.** A page whose final url is another host is a page about another
      site. Listing it puts a host in the document that the document is not about — the
      failure that titled Anthropic's artifact `# https://claude.com` (see `_origin`).

    **Both are also enforced upstream, in `internals/crawler.py`, and that is not redundant.**
    The crawler drops these pages so they never reach `runs.stats["pages_crawled"]` as
    material for an artifact, and counts each under its own reason so the provenance panel can
    name it. What is restated here is the *artifact's* own invariant, which has to hold for
    any `pages` list this module is handed — including the hand-built ones its tests use and
    any future caller that does not come through `crawl_site`. The seam is not entitled to
