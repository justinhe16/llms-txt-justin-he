"""Diffing one run's `llms.txt` index against the previous completed run's — the "what changed
in the latest run" block the Trends tab reads through `runs.stats["index_diff"]`
(`internals/run_stats.py`, `RUN_STATS_VERSION` 8).

Pure, feature-owned, no I/O — the same category `internals/run_stats.py` and
`internals/llms_txt.py` already occupy, and for the same reason CLAUDE.md #9 states for
those two: everything downstream of a fetched page stays behind a model-free seam, and this
module sits one layer further downstream than either, describing the DIFFERENCE between two
already-generated artifacts rather than generating one.

**Why this is a diff of two STRINGS, not a diff of two page lists — and, as of PER-194, not
ONLY that.** `runs.stats` cannot afford to carry a stored `indexed_pages: [{url, title}]`
list of its own — `_LIST_COLUMNS` (`runs/internals/runs_reader.py`) deliberately excludes
`llms_txt` from every row of `GET /websites/{id}/runs`, a list the Runs tab polls every three
seconds while a run is active, and re-adding an equivalent list under another name inside
`stats` would undo that exclusion at up to `crawl_max_pages` entries per row. So this module
reads back the ONE column that already exists cheaply enough to fetch per run —
`runs.llms_txt` itself, "kilobytes for any site a crawler actually meets" (`llms_txt.py`'s
`MAX_FULL_TEXT_BYTES` docstring) — and recovers the page list by parsing it.
`build_content_hashes` below is the one exception to "pure module, no I/O awareness of
`CrawledPage`": it imports `CrawledPage` from `app.features.crawl.schemas` — a frozen
dataclass with no I/O of its own — to hash a run's page BODIES as a side-channel alongside
the parsed-string diff, because a mode flip (enrichment turning on or off) rewrites title and
description without touching a page's body at all, and that side-channel is what lets this
module tell "the metadata changed because a different author wrote it" apart from "the page
itself changed" (see `build_index_diff`'s own docstring).

**Parsing BOTH sides, current and previous, is the part that actually matters.** The tempting
alternative — build the current run's entry list directly from `artifact_pages`, the same
`CrawledPage`s `generate_llms_txt` was just handed, and diff that against a PARSED previous
list — would make any imperfection in the escape round-trip (`_escape_label`/`_escape_target`
in `llms_txt.py`, `_clean`'s 500-character ellipsis) look like a page swap on every single run:
today's list built one way, yesterday's rebuilt the other way, compared as if they were the
same kind of thing. Running both sides through the identical parser makes those imperfections
cancel exactly — a title truncated the same way on both sides diffs as unchanged, because both
sides now describe what the ARTIFACT says rather than what the crawler originally saw. It also
matches what the Trends tab actually claims to show: "what changed in the site's `llms.txt`
between runs," not "what changed in the site." `test_parse_index_round_trips_generate_llms_txt`
in `tests/test_index_diff.py` is the drift gate this trades for: `parse_index` and `_bullet`
(`llms_txt.py`) are two descriptions of one format, and that test is the only thing tying them
together — see the cross-reference comment on `_bullet` itself.

    exact rather than approximate: every key this function emits either matches an
    `IndexEntry.key` derived from the same URL or matches nothing, and there is no third
    case where the two normalization rules quietly disagree, because there is only one rule.

    **The value is a truncated sha256**, `hashlib.sha256(page.markdown.encode("utf-8")
    ).hexdigest()[:CONTENT_HASH_CHARS]` — see `CONTENT_HASH_CHARS` for the collision
    arithmetic.

    **Populated from every page whose `markdown.strip()` is non-empty — deliberately NOT a
    branch on `CrawledPage.is_empty`.** ARCHITECTURE.md §3.4 is explicit that
    `generate_llms_txt` is "the ONE place in the codebase that branches on that flag";
    `internals/enrich.py`'s own module docstring already refuses the same shortcut for the
    identical reason, and this function holds the line a third time. The two signals can
    disagree in both directions — a page can be `is_empty` with non-blank `markdown` (a
    JavaScript shell whose extracted body is short but not zero) or have blank `markdown`
    while `is_empty` is `False` in principle — and reading `is_empty` here would make this
    function's population rule silently depend on `internals/extract.py`'s `MIN_BODY_CHARS`
    threshold instead of on its own stated one.

    **The key set is therefore a SUPERSET of the index** `parse_index` recovers from this same
    run's `llms.txt` — `generate_llms_txt` additionally omits an empty page from the artifact
    entirely, so a page with (say) ten characters of markdown can appear here and never appear
    as an `IndexEntry`. That is safe by construction: `build_index_diff` intersects this map's
    keys with `current_keys & previous_keys` before counting anything, so an extra key here
    simply never joins to anything and is silently ignored, and no `IndexEntry` can ever lack
    a corresponding hash (the index's population rule is strictly narrower than this one).

    **Sized like `SAMPLE_LIMIT` above bounds its own budget.** One entry per page with
    non-empty markdown, each entry roughly a normalized URL (~100-200 bytes) plus 16 hex
    characters, bounded by `Settings.crawl_max_pages` (default 100) — on the order of 10 KB
    typical, ~22 KB worst case for a run at the cap. That is real enough to matter on a
    row the Runs tab polls every three seconds, which is why `runs/service.py`'s
    `_public_stats` strips this key from every API response before it ever reaches a client;
    this function itself has no opinion about who reads its output.

    Args:
        pages: `result.pages` — the run's ORIGINALLY EXTRACTED pages, never `artifact_pages`.
            Enrichment (`internals/enrich.py`'s `apply_summaries`) rewrites `title` and
            `description` and nothing else, so the two lists produce identical hashes here —
            but reading `result.pages` makes "the body fingerprint is mode-independent" a
            property of the code this function is called with, rather than a coincidence a
            future refactor could quietly break. See the call site in `crawl/service.py` for
            the same sentence, repeated at the point where the choice is actually made.

    no earlier run at all (`previous_run_completed is None`) and an earlier run that exists
    but never completed with an index of its own (`previous_run_completed is False`, or a
    completed row whose `llms_txt` was `NULL` — `RunService.get_previous_completed_index`
    returns `None` for that case too, deliberately, since a completed run with no index
    cannot be compared against). Either way the result is the `"first_run"` shape, carrying
    no metrics at all — there is nothing to measure a delta against, and a `0` in every field
    would claim a comparison that never happened.

    **Semantics, pinned here because nowhere else states them:**

    * **`metadata_changed`** — an entry whose `key` (see `IndexEntry.key`) is present on both
      sides, with a different `title` **or** a different `description`. A same-key entry
      with both fields byte-identical is neither added, removed, nor changed; it simply
      is not counted at all, the same way an untouched row does not appear in a diff. Named
      `metadata_changed`, not `pages_changed` (PER-194's rename): title and description are
      the ONLY thing enrichment ever rewrites, so this is the one signal a mode flip
      contaminates, and the honest name says exactly that.
    * **Why `metadata_changed` is the only signal a mode flip contaminates, and every other
      signal is reported normally regardless.** Enrichment rewrites title and description and
      NOTHING else — the URL set, the extracted page bodies, and sitemap discovery are
      untouched by it (`internals/enrich.py`'s `apply_summaries`). So when
      `current_enrich_applied` disagrees with the previous run's own `enrich_applied`
      (`mode_changed` below), a `metadata_changed` count would be comparing text written by
      two different authors and calling the difference a "change" — every page in the index
      could show up as changed for no reason a reader could act on. Nothing else has that
      problem: `pages_added`/`pages_removed`/`urls_discovered_delta`/`sections_delta`/
      `selection_churn`/`selection_churn_ratio` are all about which URLs the index lists, not
      about what their bullets say, and a genuine content change is now detectable
      independently via `content_changed` (below) because `current_content_hashes` fingerprints
      page BODIES, which enrichment never touches. **Do not suppress the whole diff** — only
      `metadata_changed` degrades to `None`; everything else in this list is computed and
      returned exactly as it always was, mode flip or not, which is what
      `test_a_mode_change_still_reports_a_genuine_content_change` pins.
    * **`content_changed`** — an entry whose `key` is present in both this run's index AND
      the previous run's, where `current_content_hashes` and `previous.content_hashes` both
      have that key and disagree. `None` — never a count — when `previous.content_hashes` is
      `None` (the previous run predates `RUN_STATS_VERSION` 8, or its hashes were otherwise
      unreadable): the same "the previous row didn't record it" rule
      `urls_discovered_delta` already applies to its own predecessor field.
      Mode-independent by construction, since the hashes it joins are keyed off page bodies
      `apply_summaries` never rewrites.
    * **`metadata_not_comparable_reason`** — `None` when `metadata_changed` is a real count;
      otherwise `"enrichment_enabled"` when this run enriched and the previous one did not
      (the direction the ticket's own copy describes), or `"enrichment_disabled"` for the
      mirror case. **An unknown previous mode (`previous.enrich_applied is None`) is treated
      as COMPARABLE, not as "cannot tell"** — see the "unknown mode" paragraph below.
    * **`selection_churn`** = `pages_added + pages_removed`. **`selection_churn_ratio`** is
      that count divided by `len(current_keys | previous_keys)`, rounded to four decimal
      places, and `None` — never `0.0` — when that union is empty (both indexes have no
      entries at all; a ratio over zero pages describes nothing). "Selected pages" here means
      what the index actually LISTS, not the frontier `select_urls` chose upstream of the
      crawl: that intermediate list is never persisted anywhere `execute_run` could read it
      back from, and the index is the honest, available answer to "what does the crawler now
      consider important."
    * **`sections_delta`** — see `_sections_delta`.
    * **`llms_txt_bytes_delta`** — left reported and UNLABELLED even across a mode change.
      Enrichment rewrites every enriched page's title and description, which shifts the
      artifact's byte count regardless of whether any page was "added", "removed", or
      genuinely changed in the sense this module can still measure — this field was already
      a coarse, whole-artifact number before PER-194 and stays exactly that coarse after it;
      adding a reason to it would imply a precision this field has never actually had.
    * **Samples** (`added_sample`/`removed_sample`/`metadata_changed_sample`/
      `content_changed_sample`) — every entry in the corresponding set, sorted by `key`,
      capped at `SAMPLE_LIMIT`, each title truncated at `MAX_SAMPLE_TITLE_CHARS`. The true
      count is always recorded alongside the sample (`pages_added` etc.), so a caller
      displaying "and N more" always has an N. `metadata_changed_sample` is `[]` — never
      `null` — when `metadata_changed` is `None`, and `content_changed_sample` is `[]` when
      `content_changed` is `None`, so a client never has to guard a sample field against a
      `null` its count field does not also carry.

    **Why an unknown previous mode (`previous.enrich_applied is None`) is treated as
    comparable rather than not-comparable.** A pre-version-8 row was written back when
    enrichment was a single deployment-wide flag that defaults OFF — so "assume the same mode
    as this run" is the assumption that keeps `metadata_changed` reporting normally for every
    existing website's first run after this deploy, rather than blanking the signal for every
    site at once on a ticket that, for most of them, changed nothing about how their runs
    enrich. The one-time cost is real but bounded: a deployment that already had the global
    flag ON, for a website that opts in for the first time under this ticket, sees exactly one
    run report every page's metadata as "changed" (because it genuinely was, for that website,
    on that run) rather than as not-comparable — an artifact of the flag having always applied
    deployment-wide before this ticket existed, not a defect in this rule.

    Args:
        current_llms_txt: This run's freshly generated `llms.txt` — the same string just
            written to `runs.llms_txt`, parsed exactly once, here.
        current_urls_discovered: This run's `runs.stats["urls_discovered"]` value, for
            `urls_discovered_delta` below.
        current_enrich_applied: This run's own `enrich_applied` (PER-194) — whether at least
            one page in THIS run's index was enriched. Compared against `previous.
            enrich_applied` to decide `metadata_not_comparable_reason`.
        current_content_hashes: This run's own `build_content_hashes(result.pages)` — see
            that function's own docstring. Joined against `previous.content_hashes` to compute
            `content_changed`.
        previous: The previous completed run's index and metadata, or `None` — see above.
        previous_run_completed: Threaded straight into the returned dict either way (both the
            `"first_run"` and `"compared"` shapes carry it) — `None` when there is no earlier
            run at all, `False` when the immediately preceding run exists but did not
            complete, `True` when it did. Not derived from `previous is None`: a `"compared"`
            result is always built from a genuinely completed previous run
            (`previous_run_completed` is `True` whenever `previous is not None`), but the
            reverse does not hold — `previous is None` can mean either of the first two
            states, which is exactly why this is a separate parameter rather than inferred.

    Returns:
        A JSON-safe `dict` — every value is already a `str`, `int`, `float`, `bool`, `None`,
        a `list` of such dicts, or a `dict[str, int]` — ready to sit under `"index_diff"` in
        the dict `build_run_stats` returns.
