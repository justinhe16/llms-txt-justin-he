"""Model-assisted per-page summarization: a written title and description for every crawled
page, in place of what `internals/extract.py` pulled out of the page's own markup.

**This is the model-assisted layer ABOVE the seam, not a change to the seam itself**
(ARCHITECTURE.md §11, §3.4). `internals/llms_txt.py`'s `generate_llms_txt` and
`generate_llms_full_txt` still read `CrawledPage.title`/`CrawledPage.description` exactly as
before and still know nothing about a model; what this module does is decide, BEFORE that
seam is ever called, whether the `CrawledPage`s it is handed still carry trafilatura's own
title and description or a model's. It is flag-gated on `settings.crawl_enrich_with_llm`
(default OFF), all-or-nothing rather than gap-filling (see `Settings.crawl_enrich_with_llm`'s
own docstring for why there is no third mode), and degrades to the deterministic artifact
`internals/llms_txt.py` has always produced the moment either condition fails to hold.

**A request carries more than the page's body.** The user turn `_render_page` builds gives the
model the page's URL and the title and description the page published about itself, and only
then its extracted content — because `PROMPT` asks for a title "of the entire page based on ALL
the content", and a body alone is not all of it. `_CONTEXT_GUIDANCE` has the failure that found
this, and why the extra instruction is a second system block rather than an edit to `PROMPT`.

**`enrich_pages` never raises for an API reason, and nothing it does can fail a run.** Every
exception this module's own request loop can produce — a bad response shape, a malformed or
`MAX_TOKENS`-truncated completion, a rate limit the SDK's own retries did not clear, a network
failure — is caught per page and turned into "this page keeps its extracted metadata," never
into an exception that reaches `CrawlService.execute_run`. `CrawlService` wraps the call to
this module in its own `try/except Exception` anyway (see that method's own comment for why
that is belt-and-braces rather than redundant), but the contract starts here: a model that is
down, rate-limited, or wrong is exactly the situation this feature exists to survive.

**Reads no `is_empty` flag, and that is deliberate.** A page is skipped from THIS module's
request loop when its truncated markdown is empty after `.strip()` — because the Anthropic
Messages API rejects an empty text block in a request, which is a PRECONDITION of making a
request at all, not a judgement about the page's content. `CrawledPage.is_empty` is a
*different*, extraction-level signal (`internals/extract.py`'s `MIN_BODY_CHARS` threshold),
and ARCHITECTURE.md §3.4 is explicit that `generate_llms_txt` is "the ONE place in the
codebase that branches on that flag" — reading it here, even as a shortcut that would usually
agree with the emptiness check above, would make that sentence false.
`tests/test_crawl_enrich.py` constructs pages where the two disagree in both directions to
keep this honest.

**Why concurrent `messages.create` calls, and not the Message Batches API — read this before
"optimizing" this module to use it.** The Batch API is roughly half the per-token price of
ordinary requests, which looks like the obvious choice for exactly the workload this module
has: many small, independent, non-interactive completions. It is wrong for this codebase's
own reason, not a general one: Anthropic's own documentation gives batches up to 24 hours to
complete, and most complete "in less than 1 hour" — a *typical* case this module cannot rely
on, because arq's `job_timeout` is 600 seconds (`app/worker/policy.py`) and `crawl_site`'s own
wall-clock cap is 300 seconds (`Settings.crawl_max_wall_clock_s`) — both dramatically smaller
than even the FAST case for a batch, let alone the documented ceiling. A job that submitted a
batch and then polled `batches.retrieve()` waiting for `processing_status == "ended"` would be
cancelled by arq's own timeout long before a batch could plausibly return; `CrawlService`
would hand the run back to `pending` on that cancellation, and the retry would walk into
exactly the same wall next attempt. Making the Batch API work here would mean splitting one
run across two separate jobs (submit, then a later job that polls and finishes it) and
reworking the stuck-run reaper's staleness clock to account for a run that is intentionally
`processing` for up to a day — a different milestone than "add summarization to a run that
otherwise completes in tens of seconds." The ordinary Messages API, called concurrently under
`ENRICH_WALL_CLOCK_S` below, finishes within the same job that already fetched the pages. The
cost difference this trades away is small in absolute terms: at roughly 2,000-4,000 input
tokens and roughly 40 output tokens per page (`MAX_TOKENS` below, and `crawl_enrich_max_chars`
in `Settings`), a 100-page run costs on the order of $0.30 at `claude-haiku-4-5`'s per-token
pricing — not a number worth a two-job redesign to halve.

"""A SECOND system block, sent after `PROMPT` rather than merged into it — which is what keeps
that string's "DO NOT REWORD" rule enforceable rather than aspirational: `PROMPT` still reaches
the API byte for byte, and everything added here is additive text rendered after it. Says
nothing about the OUTPUT — no word counts, no format, no mention of how long a title should be
— because that is `PROMPT`'s job, and restating any of it here would be a reword by another
route. It describes the INPUT `_render_page` builds, and how to weigh the two sources in it.

Necessary because `PROMPT` asks for a title "of the entire page based on ALL the content", and
until this ticket the only thing a request carried was the page's body — so on a page whose body
is one promotional block and whose real content is a link grid the crawler correctly discards as
navigation, the model faithfully summarized the banner. `www.wikipedia.org` is the page that
found it: `internals/extract.py` pulled out the title "Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia" and the
real meta description, the model was shown neither, and the artifact came out titled "Wikipedia
Donation Appeal" off the CentralNotice fundraiser — the model-assisted path producing a WORSE
artifact than the deterministic one it exists to improve on. `tests/test_crawl_enrich.py` pins
that page's shape as a regression.

The last line is a cheap standing precaution, not a claim to have solved prompt injection: a
crawled page is attacker-controlled text and always was, body included. What bounds the damage
is downstream of this module — the only thing a hijacked response can produce is a bad label,
`internals/llms_txt.py`'s `_clean` cuts one at `MAX_TEXT_CHARS`, and nothing in the codebase
