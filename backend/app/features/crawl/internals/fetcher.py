"""One bounded, redirect-following, SSRF-checked GET.

`fetch_page()` is the only place in this feature that makes an HTTP request. Everything
that makes a single "fetch this URL" safe and boundable lives here:

* **Every hop is re-validated.** The seed URL and every `Location` a redirect points at go
  through `internals/ssrf.py`'s `validate_url()` before a request is made — not just the
  first one. A redirect is a URL exactly as attacker-influenced as the seed; skipping
  re-validation on hop two would make hop one's check theater.
* **httpx dials the address `validate_url()` picked, not the hostname.** See `ssrf.py`'s
  module docstring for why a second DNS lookup between check and connect is the whole
  vulnerability this ticket closes, and why that means this module must build its request
  around `target.connect_url` — never `target.host` — while still sending `target.host` as
  the `Host` header and, for `https`, as the TLS SNI name.
* **The body is a stream, never a buffer.** `response.aiter_bytes()` is read chunk by
  chunk, and each chunk is charged against a caller-supplied `ByteBudget` *before* it is
  kept — a response is never pulled entirely into memory before its size is known, so a
  hostile multi-gigabyte body is stopped as it arrives, not after.

This module now has two opinions about a page's content, not one: whether the response looks
like HTML, and if so what `internals/extract.py` makes of it — a title, a description, a
markdown body, and whether that body counts as empty — and, independently, whether the
response looks like a WAF/CDN access challenge or an outright denial rather than the page it
was asked for, `internals/blocked.py`'s `classify_block`. Both run here, inline with the one
fetch this module already makes, rather than as a second pass over `CrawledPage` later, so a
page is only ever decoded and read once. This module still has no opinion about concurrency,
deadlines, or the page cap — those remain the crawl loop's job (`internals/crawler.py`). It
fetches exactly one URL, following its own redirects, and returns exactly one `CrawledPage`
or raises — a blocked response is a SUCCESSFUL fetch, never a raise, exactly as a `404` has
always been: `internals/crawler.py` is what decides what a blocked `CrawledPage` means for
the run, this module only reports the fact.

    returns `True` for that and `application/xhtml+xml`, `False` for any other explicit media
    type (`application/json`, `application/pdf`, `text/plain`, ...), and, deliberately,
    **`True`** when the response declares no media type at all — the header absent entirely,
    empty, whitespace, or nothing but parameters (`; charset=utf-8`).

    "Declares no media type" is meant literally, and is narrower than "unparseable": a header
    with a non-empty value that is merely *malformed* (`Content-Type: garbage`, no `/`) takes
    the `False` branch, because it still constitutes the server saying something about the
    body, and nothing it could be saying is `text/html`. Only the genuinely absent declaration
    gets the benefit of the doubt below.

    That last case is a considered choice, not an oversight, and the conservative-sounding
    alternative — treat "no header" as "not HTML" — was rejected because it is actually the
    less accurate rule, not merely the more cautious one. `extract_content` is contractually
    never-raises (`internals/extract.py`): fed a non-HTML body, it returns its empty result,

    measurement instead of assumption. Fed a genuine HTML body from a server that simply

    `title=None, markdown=""`, indistinguishable in `runs.stats["pages_empty_content"]` from an
    actual JavaScript shell. That is a false positive in the exact counter this ticket adds to
    measure how often headless rendering would matter (`internals/crawler.py`,
    `internals/run_stats.py`) — silently corrupting the measurement to save a parse that was
    going to cost almost nothing anyway. So the permissive rule is never LESS accurate than
    the conservative one; its only cost is one wasted `extract_content` call on a body that
    turns out not to be markup. An absent `Content-Type` is not an assertion that the body is
    not HTML, and this function does not treat it as one. An EXPLICIT non-HTML media type is a
    real assertion and is still honored — this gate is about avoiding wasted parses on
    responses that have already said what they are, not a safety boundary; `extract_content`
    already has to tolerate arbitrary attacker-supplied bytes regardless of what this function

        `classify_block` never raises, so there is no cost to calling it unconditionally the
