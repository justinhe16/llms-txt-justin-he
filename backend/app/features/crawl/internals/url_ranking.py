"""Ranking and selecting a crawl's frontier from raw discovered URLs.

**What this module is for.** A sitemap, a `robots.txt` `Sitemap:` line, and — since
PER-178 — the `<a href>` links on a crawl's seed page all surface far more URLs than any run
should ever fetch — a documentation site's sitemap alone can list thousands. `select_urls`
takes whatever was discovered, in whatever order it was discovered in, and decides which
subset `internals/crawler.py`'s `crawl_site(seed_url, extra_urls=...)` should actually spend
its page budget on. It does not discover anything itself — that is `internals/sitemap.py`'s
job — and it does not fetch, parse HTML, or call an LLM, so it stays on the right side of
CLAUDE.md #9 and ARCHITECTURE.md §3.4: nothing here is "real crawling logic," only a decision
over metadata a discovery step has already collected.

**Wired as of PER-176.** This module landed standalone and fully tested one ticket before
anything called it for real — the same way `internals/extract.py` did — and PER-176 supplied
the discovery step it was waiting for: `service.py` now runs `internals/sitemap.py`'s
`discover_sitemap_urls` output through `select_urls` and hands `SelectionResult.selected` to
`crawl_site` as `extra_urls`, where an empty tuple used to be. Nothing in this module had to
change for that to work, which was the point of building it in isolation first.

**Why `DiscoveredUrl` lives here and not in `schemas.py`.** `schemas.py`'s own docstring
gives the reason for `CrawledPage`: a shape that never crosses the HTTP boundary and exists
only to move data between two functions in the same worker process is an honest plain
dataclass, not a Pydantic DTO with validation and an OpenAPI presence neither needs.
`DiscoveredUrl` is the same kind of value — built by a discovery step, consumed by
`select_urls`, and never returned by a router or read by the frontend — so it is declared
next to its one consumer instead of in the shared schemas module.

**Pipeline order, and why it is fixed.**

1. **Normalize.** Every candidate is reduced to the exact string that would be fetched
   (fragment stripped, scheme/host lowercased, tracking parameters dropped, trailing slash
   normalized) before anything else happens, because every later stage — dropping the seed,
   detecting duplicates, deciding what is "off origin" — is only correct if it compares like
   with like. Comparing un-normalized strings would let `https://example.com/docs` and
   `https://Example.com/docs/` both survive as if they were different URLs.
2. **Pre-filter drop rules.** Cheap, stateless checks (origin, path shape, query shape) run
   before scoring so that scoring never has to reason about URLs that were never going to be
   selected — a `/tag/`, `/2019/03/`, or off-origin URL gains nothing by being scored high.
   Cross-candidate state is limited to what pre-filtering genuinely needs: a set of
   normalized URLs already seen, for `"duplicate"`, and — when a duplicate's normalized URL
   already survived pre-filtering — an order-independent merge of its `priority` (the max of
   the non-`None` values seen) and `lastmod` (the latest of the non-`None` values seen) into
   the surviving candidate, so a URL's score never depends on which of its several
   discoveries `select_urls` happened to visit first. **`"robots_disallowed"` (PER-191) is
   checked immediately after `"off_origin"` and before the five guessed structural rules
   (`"dated_archive"` onward)** — a `robots.txt` only speaks for its own origin, so it makes
   no sense to consult before that check, and it is operator-AUTHORED rather than guessed
   from a URL's shape, so it wins the attribution over every rule this module infers on its
   own. Matched against `normalized.url` — the exact string that would be fetched — not the
   raw candidate, so a `Disallow: /docs/` does not match a normalized `/docs` that happens to
   have shed its trailing slash.
3. **Score.** Only survivors are scored, deterministically and without a clock — see the
   weight constants below for the reasoning behind each term's magnitude.
4. **Sort** by `(-score, url)`. The URL tie-break is what makes the whole pipeline
   deterministic under a shuffled input: two candidates that score identically would
   otherwise be ordered however `sorted()`'s stability happened to preserve them, which
   depends on the order `candidates` arrived in.
5. **Walk the ranked list and cap.** `"localized_duplicate"` is the one rule that cannot be
   a pre-filter, because it is only true relative to what has *already been selected* —
   `/es/docs/intro` is only a duplicate once `/docs/intro` has actually been chosen, which is
   a fact that does not exist until the walk reaches that point. Running it here, against a
   ranked (not raw) order, also means the *better*-ranked of two localized copies is the one
   kept; running it as a pre-filter over raw input order would depend on which one happened
   to appear first in `candidates`.

**Why `"off_origin"` exists at all — it is not on the ticket's own list of drop rules.**
PER-178's link extraction surfaces links to other domains (a partner's docs, a CDN, a
social share target) exactly as readily as it surfaces links to the site being crawled —
`internals/links.py` drops them on its own side too, so this rule and that filter agree by
construction rather than by coincidence, and either one alone would still hold the line. An
`llms.txt` that quietly includes another site's pages is `url_normalize.py`'s `www.`
problem's other, worse half: not two spellings of one site failing to dedupe, but one site's
artifact silently describing a different site — "a wrong artifact that looks right," in that
module's own words. Origin is compared exactly on `(scheme, host, port)`, with the port
collapsed to the scheme's default the same way `websites/internals/url_normalize.py`'s
`NormalizedUrl.origin` does — that module is the existing definition of "origin" in this
codebase, and this rule is deliberately the same equality it already uses for
`UNIQUE (user_id, origin)`. It is not imported (ARCHITECTURE.md §3.1 forbids importing
another feature's `internals/`); only the small piece needed — collapsing a default port —
is reimplemented here.

**Why a duplicate's metadata is merged rather than discarded.** A discovery step routinely
rediscovers a URL another one already listed — the same page, now carrying no
`lastmod`/`priority` at all (`source="links"` never populates either field). Simply keeping
whichever `DiscoveredUrl` `select_urls` happened to visit first would make a page's score
depend on `candidates`' input order — silently, and in the one place this module promises
the opposite (`select_urls`'s own docstring, and the determinism tests in
`tests/test_url_ranking.py`). `_merge_priority` and `_merge_lastmod` are commutative and
associative — the larger of two priorities, and the later of two `lastmod` values, do not
care which argument arrived first — so folding every duplicate of a survivor into one merged
entry, encountered in any order, always produces the same merged candidate and therefore the
same score.

**The reconciliation invariant.** For any call, `discovered_count == len(selected) +
sum(dropped.values())`. Every candidate is either selected or dropped under exactly one
named rule — never both, and never neither. `tests/test_url_ranking.py` asserts this
directly, and it is also why every drop site in this module `continue`s immediately: nothing
below the first matching rule for a candidate ever runs.

    Pure and deterministic: no `async`, no network or filesystem access, and no clock read.
    Calling this twice with the same arguments, or once with `candidates` shuffled into any
    order, produces the same `selected` list — including when the same URL is discovered
    more than once with different `priority`/`lastmod` values, which is exactly what
    `"duplicate"`'s order-independent metadata merge (module docstring) guarantees.
    `tests/test_url_ranking.py` asserts both directly.

    Args:
        candidates: Every URL a discovery step found, in whatever order it found them.
        seed_url: The run's own seed — normalized the same way every candidate is, and
            compared against it for the `"seed"` and `"off_origin"` rules. Not itself
            included in `selected` even if a candidate happens to be a byte-for-byte repeat
            of it, because the seed is fetched separately (`crawl_site`'s own first fetch)
            and already counts against the run's page cap. If `seed_url` itself cannot be
            parsed — a defensive case, since `crawl_site` has already fetched it
            successfully by the time this runs, not an expected one — every candidate fails
            the `"off_origin"` comparison against an origin that cannot be determined, and
            `selected` comes back empty. Failing CLOSED here is deliberate: failing open
            (treating an unparseable seed as "no origin restriction") would silently defeat
            the one rule `"off_origin"` exists for.
        limit: The maximum number of URLs to select. `limit <= 0` returns an empty
            `selected` without raising — every surviving candidate is counted under
            `"over_limit"` instead.
        robots: This run's parsed `robots.txt` rules (`internals/robots.py`), or `None` —
            the default, and what every call site before PER-191 is equivalent to — meaning
            "no `robots.txt` restriction, allow everything." When given, a candidate whose
            NORMALIZED url (`normalized.url` — the exact string that would be fetched, not
            the raw candidate) `robots.is_allowed(...)` refuses is dropped under
            `"robots_disallowed"` rather than being scored — see the module docstring's step
            2 for why this check sits where it does in the pipeline.
