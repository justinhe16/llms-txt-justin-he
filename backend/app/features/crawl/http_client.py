"""The single `httpx.AsyncClient` every crawl fetch is issued through.

Built once per worker process (`app/worker/settings.py`'s `open_worker_resources`, a later
phase of this ticket) and threaded through every `fetch_page` call, the same way the process
shares one asyncpg pool rather than opening a connection per job.

Lives at the top of the feature, not in `internals/`, because `app/worker/settings.py`
constructs it and `internals/` is private to this feature (ARCHITECTURE.md §3.1) — a module
another feature's setup code has to import cannot also be one only this feature may import.

The same derivation `internals/robots.py`'s private `_product_token` performs at `robots.txt`
match time; that module needs a FUNCTION rather than this constant, because it has to derive
a token from whatever `user_agent` string a caller (production or a test) hands it, not
always this process's own. This is the plain string for the caller that only ever means THIS
crawler's own token: `app.features.crawl.service`'s `_BLOCKED_MESSAGES` is that caller — the
social escape hatch a detected WAF/CDN block degrades to ("ask the site operator to allowlist
llms-text-bot") needs the crawler to be able to name itself in `runs.error`, and a hardcoded
second copy of the literal is exactly the drift this constant exists to rule out."""


def build_crawl_client(settings: Settings) -> httpx.AsyncClient:
    """Build the crawler's shared `httpx.AsyncClient`.

    `follow_redirects=False` is LOAD-BEARING, not a style preference. `internals/ssrf.py`'s
    check-then-connect defense only holds if every redirect hop is re-validated by hand
    before the next request is made (`internals/fetcher.py`); if httpx followed redirects
    itself, a validated first hop could still land on an unvalidated final one, silently
    routed through this client with no chance for `validate_url()` to see it. Do not flip
    this to `True` to "simplify" a call site — it removes the one property this whole
    ticket exists to guarantee.

    Constructing this client opens no socket and makes no network call, which is why
    `open_worker_resources` (app/worker/settings.py) can call this unconditionally in
    `on_startup` without a way for it to fail.

    **Known, accepted, and worth writing down: httpcore pools connections by
    `(scheme, host, port)` of the URL actually dialed — which, for this client, is the
    validated IP.** Two different hostnames that resolve to the same IP and port (a shared
    CDN edge, say) can therefore share one keep-alive connection, so the second request's
    `Host` header travels over a TLS session negotiated with the first hostname's SNI. This
    is NOT an SSRF hole: both hostnames must already have passed `validate_url()`
    independently, and no address the guard refused becomes reachable this way. It is a
    response-attribution wrinkle on shared-hosting IPs, in the same family as this client's
    cookie jar being keyed on the dialed IP rather than the origin host. Both are follow-ups
    for the ticket that makes the frontier span more than one host; today a run fetches a
    single site, so neither can arise.
