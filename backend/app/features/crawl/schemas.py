"""Data shapes for the crawl feature.

**Not Pydantic DTOs.** Every other feature's `schemas.py` holds request/response models
because a router serializes them across the HTTP boundary (ARCHITECTURE.md §3.1). This
feature has no router — `CrawledPage` and `CrawlOutcome` never leave the worker process, so
plain frozen dataclasses are the honest shape: no validation to perform on construction,
and no OpenAPI schema for them to appear in.

**Not named `Page`.** `app.core.pagination.Page` already exists — the generic
keyset-pagination envelope, imported as `Page` by `app.features.runs.service` and returned
by `GET /websites/{id}/runs`. A second, unrelated meaning of `Page` in this codebase would
be an import collision waiting to happen and a near-guaranteed misread in code review:
`from app.features.crawl.schemas import Page` and `from app.core.pagination import Page` in
the same file cannot both exist under that name. `CrawledPage` says what it is without
colliding with the name that was already taken.

    defaulted — a silent `0` here would be worse than the compile error a missing argument
    produces, because a `0` looks like a legitimately empty page rather than a caller that
    forgot to wire this field through.

    The number of body bytes actually charged against the run's `ByteBudget`
    (`internals/fetcher.py`) while streaming this page — what came off the wire, not
    `len(content.encode())`. Those two disagree the moment `content` is not valid UTF-8:
    `_read_body_within_budget` decodes with `errors="replace"`, which can both shrink and
    grow the byte count relative to the original bytes (a truncated multi-byte sequence
    becomes one substitution character; some replacement runs are longer than what they
    replaced), so re-encoding `content` after the fact and counting *that* would report a
    number that never actually crossed the network. `internals/payload.py`'s
    `serialize_payload` writes this value out as the payload's `bytes` field for exactly this

    documentation pages omit a description entirely, and that is the normal case, not an
    error one.

    Appended here, after `content_bytes`, along with `markdown` and `is_empty` below, for
    the same reason `content_bytes` documents its own position: a field inserted anywhere
    but the end of this dataclass would silently reorder every positional `CrawledPage(...)`
    construction already in this codebase into the wrong parameters, rather than raising.
    Required, not defaulted, for the same reason too — a caller that forgot to wire

    **Why this field exists alongside `content` rather than replacing it.** `content` is
    this run's archival record of what the server actually sent — the payload
    `internals/payload.py` writes to Storage is meant to outlive today's extractor, and
    re-extracting from the original markup later (a trafilatura upgrade, a bug fix in
    `internals/extract.py`, a wider extraction pass) is only possible if that markup was
    kept rather than discarded the moment this feature's own pass over it finished.
    `markdown` is that pass's answer for today's callers, most directly the
    `generate_llms_txt` seam (ARCHITECTURE.md §3.4); the two fields serve different readers,
    and neither is a derived form of the other that could be dropped to save space.

    `RUN_STATS_VERSION` 2 onwards).

    **Exactly one thing branches on it, and it is not upstream of the seam.**
    `internals/llms_txt.py`'s `generate_llms_txt` omits an empty page from the index it builds
    (PER-179): a bullet carrying a URL, no title and no description is not worth a line in a
    curated index. An earlier revision of this docstring said the flag was "otherwise inert"
    and that nothing downstream of this dataclass could act on it — true while the artifact
    was a stub, and no longer. What survives unchanged is the rule that actually mattered:
    nothing UPSTREAM of that seam may decide what to fetch, what to keep, or how to crawl
    because a page is empty. The page is still fetched, still written to the run's payload,
    and still counted. In particular, `title` above is never nulled when this is `True` — see
    `internals/fetcher.py`'s own comment on that decision, and note that `generate_llms_txt`
    now depends on it: an empty homepage's `<title>` is what names the whole artifact.

    called by `internals/fetcher.py`'s `fetch_page` on every response, copied straight across
    exactly as `description`/`markdown`/`is_empty` above are. One of `"challenge"`
    (an interactive challenge this crawler does not attempt to solve — Cloudflare's managed
    challenge is the one this feature has actually met) or `"denied"` (a flat `401`/`403` with
    no challenge markers — HTTP basic auth, an IP allowlist, or an unconditional WAF rule), or
    `None` for an ordinary response, blocked or not in the everyday sense of that word: a `404`
    is not a block, and neither is a `429` or a bare `503` — see that module's own docstring
    for the full rule set.

    Typed `str | None`, not `internals.blocked.BlockReason | None` — `schemas.py` has no
    router and imports nothing else from `internals/` (this file's own module docstring), and
    keeping that true is worth a slightly looser type here for the same reason
    `RunDiscoverySource` in `service.py` exists as its own `Literal` rather than being imported
    onto this dataclass: the vocabulary is owned by `internals/blocked.py`, not restated as an
    import a table-free, router-free schema module would otherwise never need.

    **Exactly two things branch on it, and both are downstream of the seam, matching the rule
    `is_empty` already sets (ARCHITECTURE.md §3.4).** `internals/crawler.py`'s `crawl_site`
    reads it on the SEED to decide whether the run has anything to build an artifact from at
    all — a blocked seed becomes `AccessBlockedError`, the seed is never appended to `pages`,
    and the run fails outright, mirroring `RobotsDisallowedError`'s own "this site said no"
    wiring. On a FRONTIER page it is counted (`runs.stats["pages_blocked"]`,
    `["blocked_reason"]`) and the page is left out of `pages` — a Cloudflare challenge shell
    has nothing this run's artifact should list — but the crawl continues; a WAF blocking a
    handful of a site's pages is not a reason to discard everything else in reach, the same
    "hitting a cap is a success" reasoning §3.4 already applies to the six crawl caps. Nothing
    UPSTREAM of either check — sitemap discovery, URL ranking, the politeness gate — reads this
    field or the response facts it is derived from.

    Required, not defaulted, appended LAST after `is_empty` for the identical
    positional-construction reason every field above states for itself: a caller that forgot
    to wire `classify_block` through gets a `TypeError` at the one call site
    (`internals/fetcher.py`'s `fetch_page`) that constructs a `CrawledPage`, not a
    `CrawledPage` that silently claims every response passed through clean."""
