"""Business logic for the runs feature: five unscoped reads, and writes reached from two
completely different directions.

**This feature has a writer, and transactions.** `internals/runs_writer.py` exists, and
three methods here open a `transaction()` (`app.infrastructure.db.transaction`,
ARCHITECTURE.md §5). An earlier revision of this docstring said "no writer, and no
transaction anywhere in this file," and predicted that whichever ticket added the first write
"adds `internals/runs_writer.py` and a `transaction()` call beside these methods; it does not
retrofit one into `list_runs` or `get_run`." That is exactly what happened, twice over:

* `trigger_run` — the HTTP write behind `POST /websites/{id}/runs`, with its abuse caps and
  duplicate-run guard in the private helpers beside it.
* `claim_for_processing`, `record_success`, and `record_failure` — the worker's trio, called
  from `app.worker.jobs.crawl_task` by way of `app.features.crawl.service.CrawlService`.
  `claim_for_processing` wraps `RunsWriter.claim_pending`, the atomic `pending -> processing`
  guard the crawl takes before it fetches a single byte. `record_success` wraps
  `RunsWriter.mark_processing_completed`, writing both generated artifacts for a crawl whose
  payload has already been uploaded to Storage. `record_failure` wraps
  `RunsWriter.mark_processing_failed`, for a crawl that never produces an artifact — whether
  because the seed never fetched, the crawl itself raised, or the Storage upload after a
  successful crawl failed. All three are independent
  transactions on purpose — the crawl, and the Storage upload `record_success` requires to
  have already happened, both happen BETWEEN them, and a network call must never run inside a
  transaction (ARCHITECTURE.md §5.1).

* `release_claim` and `reap_stuck_runs` — PER-166's recovery pair, and the reason this
  service now has a method nothing HTTP can reach at all. `release_claim` hands a claimed run
  back to `pending` when the worker holding it is cancelled or hits a transient failure with
  retries left; `reap_stuck_runs` is the cron-driven backstop for every run whose worker
  never got that far. They share one statement (`RunsWriter.return_processing_to_pending`) on
  purpose: a run rescued by its own worker and a run rescued five minutes later by the reaper
  must land in the same state, or the two paths will drift.

`list_runs`, `get_run`, `get_website_stats`, and — as of PER-181 — `get_llms_txt` and
`get_llms_full_txt` are unchanged by any of it, and open no transaction of their own; the
latter two share one private helper, `_get_artifact`, rather than being two independent
copies of the same two `404`s.

**Reads are still unscoped, the same rule `websites/service.py` follows.** None of the five
ever looks at who is asking — `CurrentUserId` is threaded through `app.api.routers.runs`
purely to require a token (ARCHITECTURE.md §4.1).

**`require_owner` appears exactly once, and its absence elsewhere is also deliberate.** It is
called inside `trigger_run`, because that is the one method here reached by an HTTP caller
who could fail to own the resource. It is *not* called by `claim_for_processing` or
`record_failure`, and adding it there would be meaningless rather than safer:
`require_owner` (ARCHITECTURE.md §4.2) compares a resource's owner to a caller, and a
background job acting on its own behalf has no caller to compare against. Ownership on the
worker's writes is a question that does not arise, not one this file forgot to ask.

**`RunService` depends on `WebsiteService`, never on `WebsitesReader`.** `list_runs` and
`trigger_run` both have to 404 on an unknown website before anything else about it means
something, and ARCHITECTURE.md §3.1 is explicit about how one feature gets data another
feature owns: "it calls B's service, never B's reader." Reimplementing "does this website
exist, and who owns it?" against `WebsitesReader` here would be a second copy of a check
`WebsiteService.get_website` already makes, free to drift from it the next time either one
changes.

**`duration_ms` is computed here, in Python, never in SQL.** `_shared_fields` below is the
one function both DTO builders call to turn a `started_at`/`completed_at` pair into a
milliseconds figure. Keeping the computation out of `internals/runs_reader.py` is what
guarantees it can never end up referenced by an `ORDER BY` there — a computed sort key
cannot use the `(website_id, started_at DESC)` index the keyset query depends on, at any
cost from "slower" to "a sequential scan", and that module's docstring spells out exactly
what the working alternative costs instead. There is exactly one function that computes
`duration_ms` in this whole codebase, which is what makes "compute it in Python" and "never
sort on it" impossible to accidentally pull apart.

**Importing `arq.connections.ArqRedis` here, never `app.worker`.** `trigger_run` takes an
already-open `ArqRedis` pool as a parameter, never a `WorkerSettings` and nothing from
`app.worker.jobs`. `arq` is a third-party package, and ARCHITECTURE.md §3.1's import-direction
rule constrains this project's own layers, not third-party libraries — the same point
`websites/service.py` makes about importing FastAPI. Importing `app.worker` itself would be
a different matter: ARCHITECTURE.md §3.3 is explicit that "nothing in `app/api/` or
`app/features/` imports `app/worker/` — the dependency runs the other way, so the queue
never enters a request path." The job this method enqueues is therefore referenced by NAME,
`CRAWL_TASK_JOB_NAME` below, not by importing a function — which also happens to be the only
option available today, since PER-159 is building `app.worker.jobs.crawl_task` concurrently
with this ticket and it does not exist yet. `tests/test_run_trigger_api.py`'s
`test_crawl_task_job_name_matches_the_worker_function` is what turns "this string must stay
character-identical to the worker's function name" from a comment into something CI checks,
automatically, the moment PER-159 lands.

## The insert/enqueue ordering — the sharpest §5.1 case in this codebase

`trigger_run` writes a `runs` row and enqueues an arq job that names it, and those two things
happen in exactly this order, with a COMMITTED transaction boundary between them:

```python
async with transaction(self._pool) as tx:
    row = await RunsWriter(tx).insert_manual(website_id)
# COMMITTED HERE.
await queue.enqueue_job(CRAWL_TASK_JOB_NAME, str(row["id"]))
```

Both orderings have a failure mode. This one is chosen because its failure mode is
recoverable and the other one's is not:

* **Enqueue-first** would let a worker see a `run_id` before the row behind it is committed.
  A worker that dequeues and starts processing in that window finds no row at all, and if
  the transaction then rolled back for an unrelated reason, the job on the queue would
  reference a run that never existed and never will — nothing can reconcile that after the
  fact, because there is no row to attach the correction to.
* **Insert-first** (what this does) can leave a `pending` row with no job behind it, if
  `enqueue_job` raises after the insert already committed. This method does not let that
  failure pass silently — see `except Exception` below — but even a version of this method
  that did nothing about it would still be the safer of the two orderings, because "a row
  exists with nothing acting on it" is a known, nameable state a reaper can sweep, while "a
  job exists that names a row that was never committed" has no state a database query could
  ever find.

**Never enqueue inside `transaction()`.** ARCHITECTURE.md §5.1 forbids holding a database
transaction open across a network call, and enqueuing onto Redis is one. Doing it inside the
block above would tie up a pooled connection for however long Redis takes to acknowledge,
for zero benefit: the enqueue's outcome has no bearing on whether the INSERT that already
happened should be kept.

**`except Exception` on the enqueue, not `except RedisError`.** arq's `enqueue_job` can
surface `redis.exceptions.RedisError`, `OSError`, `asyncio.TimeoutError`, or
`ConnectionError`, depending on exactly how the connection failed, and this method's
contract is "no run row is ever left `pending` with nothing behind it" — narrowing the
`except` to one exception type would leave every other type as a hole in that promise, and
there is no way to enumerate in advance every exception a Redis client can raise across a
bad network. The original exception is logged with `exc_info=True`; the message never
includes `REDIS_URL` or any part of it (ARCHITECTURE.md §9.4), and the caller sees a `503`.

## The races, documented honestly

The duplicate-run guard and both abuse caps below are check-then-act, not atomic with the
INSERT that follows them. Two simultaneous `POST`s for the same website, or from the same
user against the same cap, can both pass every check and both insert — there is no partial
unique index on `(website_id)` scoped to active runs that would make the 409 airtight, and
adding one is a migration this ticket does not own (CLAUDE.md #2: schema changes get their
own ticket, not a side effect of one that was not scoped to carry one). The acceptance
criterion this method is built against is the SEQUENTIAL double-click — the same request,
repeated once the first has landed — and every check below does catch that. A brief
overshoot of a cap under genuine concurrency (two tabs, two devices, a client retry racing
its own original request) is an accepted cost of enforcing this in application code rather
than in the database, and it self-corrects the moment the in-flight run in question finishes
or the 24h window moves.

## Two methods that take an already-open `Connection`, and why they are the only ones

`create_scheduled_run` and `website_ids_with_active_runs` are shaped differently from every
other method on this service: they take a `connection: Connection` keyword argument, run one
reader or writer call on it, and open no transaction of their own. That shape exists for
exactly one caller — `ScheduleService.run_due_schedules`, the cron tick — and for a reason
worth spelling out rather than discovering by reading two call sites and wondering why they
disagree with the rest of this file.

The cron tick has to lock `schedules` rows and insert the `runs` rows they produce in **one**
transaction (§5: one unit of work), and it has to do it without either feature reaching into
the other's `internals/` (§3.1). Those two rules can only both hold if the runs SQL stays
behind `RunService` while executing on the connection the *caller's* `transaction()` opened.
So these two methods take a `Connection` keyword argument, run one reader/writer call on it,
and open no transaction of their own — the same relationship a `Writer` already has to the
connection it is constructed with, lifted one layer up. They are deliberately the only methods
here shaped that way; every other method on this service owns its own unit of work. The
alternative — `ScheduleService` importing `RunsWriter` — is the import §3.1 exists to forbid,
and the other alternative — two transactions — would let a schedule advance without its run,
or a run exist whose schedule never advanced.

        that will never finish. Nothing else in this system can recover from that; there is
        no user-facing cancel, and the worker that stranded the row is, by definition, gone.

        **It rescues `RunService.record_failure`'s own failure, which nothing else can.**
        That method opens a transaction and writes a terminal row; if Postgres is unreachable
        at exactly that moment the write raises, the exception propagates out of the job, and
        the run stays `processing` forever — the process that knew what happened has no way
        left to record it. This reaper is the only thing that closes that hole, which is why
        it reads the database rather than trusting any in-process bookkeeping.

        The Redis enqueue happens strictly after the commit (ARCHITECTURE.md §5.1): holding

        outage into a `runs`-table outage for every crawl worker and every API read in the
        system.

        **Two decisions, one per class of stranded run:**

        * A `processing` run whose claim is older than `stuck_before` is either handed back
          to `pending` and re-enqueued (it has attempts left) or marked `failed` (it does
          not). `attempts` is what decides, and it is never rolled back — a run cancelled by
          every deploy must eventually stop retrying rather than loop forever.
        * A `pending` run older than `orphaned_before` is re-enqueued with no write at all.
          It is already in the state it should be in; what it is missing is a job.

        Args:
            queue: arq's own `ArqRedis` pool, handed in by `reaper_tick` from `ctx["redis"]`
                — the same relationship `ScheduleService.run_due_schedules` has to it.
            stuck_before: `processing` runs claimed before this instant are abandoned.
            orphaned_before: `pending` runs created before this instant have no job.
            max_attempts: The retry budget, `MAX_ATTEMPTS` from `app/worker/policy.py`.
                Passed in rather than imported: ARCHITECTURE.md §3.3 forbids anything under
                `app/features/` from importing `app/worker/`, and a test wants to set it to 1
                without touching global state.

        job id, and return `(enqueued, already_queued, failures)`.

        **`_job_id` is what keeps the orphan sweep from amplifying.** A `pending` run is
        re-enqueued with no write to show for it, so nothing stops the NEXT pass, five
        minutes later, from finding the same row and enqueuing a second job — and the pass
        after that a third. `f"crawl:{run_id}:{attempts}"` closes that: arq refuses to
        enqueue a job whose id already exists and returns `None` instead, so every pass after
        the first is a no-op rather than another job. Without it, a genuinely backlogged
        queue (a `pending` run legitimately waiting behind `MAX_JOBS = 2` for an hour) would
        collect one junk job every five minutes for as long as the backlog lasted.

        `attempts` is part of the id, not decoration. It is what makes the id unique per
        ATTEMPT rather than per run, so that a run legitimately re-enqueued after a later
        claim is not silently deduplicated against a job from a previous attempt whose result
        key is still in Redis (arq keeps results for `keep_result`, an hour by default). The
        pairing is safe in the other direction too: `attempts` only ever increases, and it
        increases exactly when a job claims the run, so the reaper can never need the same
        `(run_id, attempts)` id twice for two different pieces of work.

        This is deliberately the ONLY enqueue site in the codebase that passes `_job_id`.
        `trigger_run` and the cron tick each enqueue exactly once for a freshly-inserted run,
        so they have nothing to deduplicate against; giving them ids would buy nothing and
        would put a second, subtler failure mode (a stale result key silently swallowing a
        real enqueue) on the two paths a user actually waits on. The cost of leaving them
        alone is bounded and one-off: the first sweep of a run that IS still queued under
        arq's own random id adds one duplicate job, which `claim_pending` absorbs — every
        sweep after that dedupes against this id.

        Broad `except Exception`, not `except RedisError`, for the reason
        `ScheduleService._enqueue` gives for its own loop. A failure here is counted and the
        loop continues; unlike the tick's enqueue path, it does NOT mark the run failed. The
        run is legitimately `pending` and the next pass will try again in five minutes, which
        is a strictly better answer than converting a transient Redis blip into a terminal
        failure on a run that has done nothing wrong.

        current one actually completed — what `CrawlService._build_index_diff`
        (`crawl/service.py`, PER-193) needs to build this run's `index_diff` block.

        Called only from the worker path, on `CrawlService.execute_run`'s no-transaction
        window between `claim_for_processing` and `record_success` — the same window the
        Storage upload and the enrichment call already occupy (`crawl/service.py`'s module
        docstring, §5.1). **No transaction, no ownership check**, for the identical reasoning
        `claim_for_processing` gives for itself: a background job acting on its own behalf has
        no caller to check ownership against, and this read has no write to be atomic with.

        Args:
            website_id: The current run's own website.
            before_started_at: The current run's `started_at` — "previous" is relative to
                THIS run, never to `datetime.now(UTC)`.
            before_run_id: The current run's own id, the tie-break half of the keyset pair.

        Returns:
            `(previous, previous_run_completed)`.

            `previous` is `None` in two cases the caller cannot tell apart from this return
            value alone (and does not need to — both feed `build_index_diff`'s `state:
            "first_run"` branch identically): there is no completed run before this one at
            all, or the nearest completed row has `llms_txt IS NULL` — a completed run with
            no index cannot be compared against, so it is treated the same as none existing.
            Otherwise it carries that run's id, `completed_at`, `llms_txt`, and three
            defensively parsed `stats` fields — `urls_discovered` (`int` only), `enrich_applied`
            (`bool` only, PER-194), and `content_hashes` (`dict[str, str]` only, PER-194) —
            `None` for anything else, including a row that predates the `RUN_STATS_VERSION`
            each one was added at or has unparseable `stats` — read through `_parse_stats`,
            the same defensive decoder `_shared_fields` uses for every other read of this
            column (unfiltered here, unlike `_shared_fields`'s own `_public_stats`: this is
            the one legitimate consumer of `content_hashes` outside the worker path that
            wrote it).

            `previous_run_completed` is a tri-state independent of `previous`: `None` when
            there is no earlier run of ANY status, `False` when the immediately preceding run
            exists but is not `completed`, `True` when it is. Note that `previous is not None`
            implies `previous_run_completed is True`, but not the reverse — the run
            immediately before this one can be `completed` while still having no `llms_txt`,
            which is the one case where `previous_run_completed` is `True` and `previous` is
            still `None`.

        Both artifacts arrive already generated — `internals/llms_txt.py` produced them from
        the fetched pages before the upload below, and this method neither inspects nor
        reshapes either one. Adding `llms_full_txt` (PER-179) changed nothing about the
        ordering argument that follows: it is one more column in the same single UPDATE,
        inside the same single transaction, opened at the same moment.

        **The Storage upload has ALREADY HAPPENED by the time this is called.**
        `storage_path` is `SupabaseStorage.upload`'s return value, not a location this method
        is about to write to — `app.features.crawl.service.CrawlService.execute_run` uploads
        the payload first and calls this only once that upload has succeeded. Reversing that
        order — opening this transaction and uploading from inside it — is exactly the
        ordering ARCHITECTURE.md §5.1 forbids: it would hold a database transaction open
        across a network call whose duration this codebase does not control, and it would let
        a run be recorded `completed` before the artifact it points at necessarily exists.

        Opens exactly one `transaction(self._pool)` and calls
        `RunsWriter.mark_processing_completed` inside it. **Nothing else may go in that
        block** — no network call, no second statement — for the same reason every other
        transaction in this codebase is kept to one unit of work (ARCHITECTURE.md §5).

        If the writer returns `False`, the row was no longer `processing` — something else
        (a redelivered job that raced this one, a reaper) already reached a terminal state.
        That is logged at WARNING, naming `run_id`, rather than raised: the object this run's
        payload was uploaded to is now an orphan, which is the benign half of the
        upload-then-write ordering trade — a wasted upload costs a fraction of a cent, while
        the alternative ordering could have left a `completed` row pointing at nothing. See
