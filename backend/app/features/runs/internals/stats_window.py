"""`resolve_window` — the one pure function that turns a requested window name into the fixed
set of buckets `RunService.get_website_stats` aggregates over.

This module lives in `runs/internals/` for the same reason `next_run.py` lives in
`schedules/internals/` (ARCHITECTURE.md §3.1): feature-owned logic with no I/O and no state,
tested exhaustively on its own, and imported by exactly one service.

**Why this has to be pure.** `GET /websites/{id}/stats?window=` derives a bucket size, a
bucket count, and a half-open `[start, end)` range entirely from `window` and the current
instant — no database access is involved in deciding *what to ask for*, only in answering it.
A function of `(name, now)` — with no hidden call to `datetime.now()` inside — is what makes
every boundary exhaustively testable with a fixed clock (`tests/test_stats_window.py`), the
same reason `compute_next_run_at` takes `now` as a required keyword argument instead of an
ambient one.

**The mapping is a module-level `Final` dict keyed by the window name** — never built from
the raw request string. `StatsWindowName` is a `Literal`, so an unrecognized value is already
a `422` at the FastAPI boundary before this module ever runs; `_WINDOWS` only has to answer
for the three names that literal admits.

| window | bucket | step   | bucket_count |
| ------ | ------ | ------ | ------------ |
| `12h`  | `hour` | 1 hour | 12           |
| `1d`   | `hour` | 1 hour | 24           |
| `3d`   | `hour` | 1 hour | 72           |

All three currently bucket hourly, so `_truncate`'s `day` branch and `StatsBucketName`'s
`"day"` are unexercised. Both stay: the bucket is DATA in `_WINDOWS`, so a longer, daily
window is one row here rather than a change to this function, its response schema, and the
generated frontend client.

**Boundary arithmetic**, all in UTC (`now` is converted with `.astimezone(UTC)` first, so a
caller in any offset gets the same buckets a UTC clock would):

    last_bucket = truncate(now, bucket)   # hour -> zero min/sec/us; day -> also zero hour
    start       = last_bucket - (bucket_count - 1) * step
    end         = last_bucket + step      # exclusive; covers the whole current bucket

This yields exactly `bucket_count` buckets for every window. The range is half-open
`[start, end)`, and `date_trunc` (in `runs_reader.py`'s `_WEBSITE_STATS`) partitions it into
non-overlapping buckets on that same boundary — which is what makes "a run at the edge of a
bucket is counted exactly once, never twice and never zero times" true.
