"""Every `SELECT` for the runs feature. `internals/runs_writer.py`, beside this file, holds
every write: the manual-trigger insert behind `POST /websites/{id}/runs`, plus the atomic
`pending -> processing` claim and the terminal-failure record the crawl feature's worker job
needs.

Nothing below this docstring changed to make room for any of them — every query here is
still a plain `SELECT`, and this reader knows nothing about `runs_writer.py`. The three
queries `_ACTIVE_FOR_WEBSITE`, `_COUNT_ACTIVE_MANUAL_FOR_USER`, and
`_COUNT_AND_OLDEST_SINCE_FOR_USER` belong to the manual-trigger path even though all three are
`SELECT`s: the duplicate-run guard and both abuse caps are read-then-decide checks the service
runs before it opens a transaction, not writes in their own right. A fourth,
`_WEBSITE_IDS_WITH_ACTIVE_RUNS`, belongs to a different write path entirely — the cron tick's
`ScheduleService.run_due_schedules`, reached only through `RunService.website_ids_with_active_
runs` (ARCHITECTURE.md §3.1: one feature calls another feature's service, never its reader) —
and is documented beside `_ACTIVE_FOR_WEBSITE` below because it answers the same underlying
question in batch rather than one website at a time.

**READS IN THIS FILE ARE INTENTIONALLY NOT SCOPED TO THE CALLER — WITH ONE NAMED EXCEPTION.**
Same rule as `websites_reader.py` (ARCHITECTURE.md §4.1): `list_by_website` returns a
website's runs to ANY signed-in user, not merely its owner, and `get_by_id` returns any run,
including its `llms_txt`, to any signed-in user. `get_artifact` (PER-181), below, is the same
rule again — any signed-in user may download any run's `llms.txt` or `llms-full.txt`. Do not
add `WHERE user_id = $1` to any of them — there is no `user_id` column on `runs` in the first
place, but the same principle applies to `website_id`-scoping-as-a-security-measure: the
`website_id` filter below exists because "this website's runs" is the endpoint's documented
contract, not because it is standing in for an ownership check.

The exception is the two new cap queries, `count_active_manual_for_user` and
`count_and_oldest_since_for_user`, and it is worth spelling out why they are not a
contradiction of the paragraph above. Both take `user_id` and both filter on it — but "how
many runs is THIS caller responsible for right now" is `POST /websites/{id}/runs`'s
documented, product-level contract ("your caps"), the exact carve-out §4.1's last paragraph
describes for "a genuinely user-filtered feature": a reader may accept `user_id` as a query
argument when the endpoint's contract says it filters. It is not standing in for
`require_owner` — `RunService.trigger_run` already calls that, on the *website*, before
either of these queries runs — and it is not an ownership check on the run being created,
which does not exist yet when these run.

## The deliberate asymmetry: duplicate guard vs. concurrency cap vs. daily cap

Three queries below look like they should agree on which runs they count, and they do not,
on purpose:

- **`_ACTIVE_FOR_WEBSITE`** (the duplicate-run guard) has **no `trigger` filter**: ANY
  `pending`/`processing` run for that website is a 409, scheduled ones included. Two
  concurrent crawls of the same site are wasteful and produce interleaved writes to the same
  `llms_txt` regardless of what started either one — the website does not care who asked.
- **`_COUNT_ACTIVE_MANUAL_FOR_USER`** (the concurrency cap) counts `trigger = 'manual'`
  **only**. A site on an hourly schedule would otherwise occupy one of a user's two
  concurrency slots for a large fraction of every hour — a scheduled run the user did not
  even ask for right now, blocking a manual one they did.
- **`_COUNT_AND_OLDEST_SINCE_FOR_USER`** (the daily cap) counts **every** trigger. It is a
  total-work budget, and a scheduled crawl costs the same worker time a manual one does — the
  cap exists to bound load, not to bound button-clicks.

## Why the two cap queries are separate queries, not one with a `FILTER` clause

A single query answering both caps at once would need `WHERE websites.user_id = $1` with no
bound on `started_at`, scanning every run the user has EVER had and using neither index well.
Two queries, each shaped to use its own index — `runs_status_active_idx` (the partial index
on `pending`/`processing`) for the active count, `runs_website_id_started_at_idx` per site for
the windowed count — is cheaper, and it is the shape the ticket itself describes.

## The keyset query — read this before touching it

`_LIST_BY_WEBSITE_AFTER_CURSOR` (and its `_WITH_STATUS` sibling) compares the sort key as a
ROW:

    WHERE website_id = $1 AND (started_at, id) < ($2, $3)
    ORDER BY started_at DESC, id DESC

**Do not "simplify" that into the logically identical, manually OR-expanded form:**

    WHERE website_id = $1
      AND (started_at < $2 OR (started_at = $2 AND id < $3))

Both return the same rows. They are not equally fast. One benchmark, so that the two numbers
below are directly comparable: **87,600 runs for one website** (ten years of hourly
crawling), `started_at` tied 4-deep, asking for a page **5,000 rows in**, against
`runs_website_id_started_at_idx (website_id, started_at DESC)` on PostgreSQL 14.18 after
`ANALYZE`:

  * **Row-value form (the one below).** Postgres decomposes the row constructor and pushes
    `website_id = $1 AND started_at <= $2` straight into the Index Cond, so the scan STARTS
    at the cursor. The tuple comparison survives only as a Filter discarding the couple of
    rows that bound could not exclude on its own — **2 rows removed, 5 buffers, 0.019 ms**.
  * **OR-expanded form.** The planner does NOT push the `started_at` bound into the Index
    Cond. The scan starts at the newest run and walks — then discards — every row the client
    has already paged past — **5,001 rows removed, 336 buffers, 0.427 ms**. Same index, same
    result set, 67x the buffers.

That gap is a function of PAGE DEPTH, not of table size: it is ~0 on page 1 and grows
linearly as the client pages, which is precisely why it survives the manual spot-check a
reviewer is most likely to run. Independently reproduced on PostgreSQL 16 against a ~270k-row
table (4,001 rows removed / 90 buffers, versus 1 row removed / 5 buffers), so it is a
property of how the planner treats the two predicate shapes rather than an artifact of one
version or one dataset.

`tests/test_runs_api.py`'s EXPLAIN tests import the exact query constants below and pin their
plan shape, so a regression here fails a test instead of only a production dashboard. Those
tests deliberately use a far smaller fixture than the benchmark above — 5,000 rows, a cursor
1,000 deep — which is enough for the planner to choose an index scan and for the shape
assertions to mean something, while still running in milliseconds on every `pytest`
invocation. The figures in this docstring are documentation of a one-off benchmark, not
values CI asserts.

## Why the SELECT list and ORDER BY are both plain columns

`ORDER BY started_at DESC, id DESC` touches only the two raw columns
`runs_website_id_started_at_idx` is built on, and every query below selects plain columns —
nothing computed, nothing aliased to an expression the ORDER BY then references. A computed
sort key cannot use an index at all: Postgres would have to materialize every matching row,
evaluate the expression, and sort the result set from scratch, which is exactly the
"OR-expanded form" cost above but for every row rather than only the ones near the cursor.
`duration_ms` is therefore computed in Python, in `service.py`, and never appears in a
`SELECT` or `ORDER BY` in this file. A reviewer can verify the rule holds by reading the
four query constants below — none of them contains an expression.

## Four fixed query shapes, not one assembled with string concatenation

`list_by_website` picks among `_LIST_BY_WEBSITE`, `_LIST_BY_WEBSITE_WITH_STATUS`,
`_LIST_BY_WEBSITE_AFTER_CURSOR`, and `_LIST_BY_WEBSITE_AFTER_CURSOR_WITH_STATUS` by which of
`cursor` / `status` are present, rather than building the WHERE clause with an f-string at
call time. That is what lets the EXPLAIN test import "the exact SQL string the reader uses"
as a plain module constant and assert against it directly — a query built at call time has
no single string a test could import without re-deriving it, which is exactly the kind of
drift this module docstring is trying to prevent two paragraphs up.

## `_WEBSITE_STATS` is the one exception to "no computed expressions in a SELECT"

The "plain columns only" rule two sections up exists to keep the four keyset-pagination
queries above on `runs_website_id_started_at_idx` — a computed sort key cannot use that
index. `_WEBSITE_STATS` (`website_stats`, below) is a bucketed aggregate with no keyset
`ORDER BY` to protect: its `WHERE` is still a plain indexed range on `(website_id,
started_at)`, but its `SELECT` computes averages, `date_trunc` buckets, and a zero-filled
`generate_series` join on purpose, because there is no index ordering downstream of an
aggregate for a computed column to break.

## `_ARTIFACT_QUERIES` — an allowlist, not a query built at call time (PER-181)

`get_artifact` below serves `GET /runs/{id}/llms.txt` and `GET /runs/{id}/llms-full.txt`. Two
fixed query shapes, keyed by `ArtifactKind` in `_ARTIFACT_QUERIES`, for the same reason the
four keyset queries above are four constants — the column that varies is a COLUMN NAME, which
cannot travel as a bind parameter, so it is validated against this allowlist instead. Both
queries `JOIN websites` — the third query pair in this file to do so, after the two cap counts
above — for the same reason those do: `websites.origin` is NOT NULL and reachable only through
`runs.website_id`, and a run row cannot outlive its website (`ON DELETE CASCADE`,
`db/schema.prisma`), so the join is guaranteed to produce a row. See the two query constants'
own comments for the rest of the reasoning.

#
#   * `processing` past the staleness threshold — a worker claimed the run and never came

#     or `RunService.record_failure`'s own write failing against an unreachable Postgres,
#     which leaves the row `processing` with nothing left in that process able to fix it.
#   * `pending` past the orphan threshold — the insert-then-enqueue ordering that both
#     `RunService.trigger_run` and the cron tick commit to (see `runs/service.py`'s module
#     docstring) can leave a committed row with no job behind it.

# what `runs_status_active_idx`'s partial predicate answers. Splitting the reaper into two
# queries — one `WHERE status = 'processing'`, one `WHERE status = 'pending'` — would have
# read more cleanly and would have relied on the planner PROVING that each implies the
# index's `IN` list, which is a weaker guarantee than matching it. The per-status conditions
# therefore sit in a second, parenthesized clause underneath, filtering rows the index has
# already narrowed to the in-flight ones.
#
# `COALESCE(claimed_at, started_at)` on the `processing` branch, never a bare `claimed_at`.
# `claimed_at` is written by `RunsWriter.claim_pending`, so every row claimed before PER-166's
# migration has it `NULL` — and `NULL < $1` is not true, which would make exactly the runs
# stranded by the OLD code permanently invisible to the reaper built to rescue them. The
# fallback also bounds the damage of any future path that reaches `processing` without
# stamping a claim: such a row is reaped late rather than never.
#
# `started_at` on the `pending` branch, because that is the only clock a run that was never
# claimed has — `claimed_at` is `NULL` by definition there, and `_RETURN_PROCESSING_TO_PENDING`
# clears it again whenever the reaper hands a run back.
#
# `FOR UPDATE SKIP LOCKED`, for two distinct reasons, and the second is the load-bearing one:
#
#   1. Two reapers — two worker machines, or one pass overlapping its successor — must not
#      both act on the same row. Note that the guarded writes underneath would already make a
#      double-act harmless rather than corrupting, since every statement in `runs_writer.py`
#      names the status it may leave, so this is defence in depth rather than the only
#      defence.
#   2. **The reaper must never BLOCK on a row a worker is actively transitioning.** A plain
#      `FOR UPDATE` would queue behind `claim_pending`'s or `mark_processing_completed`'s row
#      lock and hold a pooled connection until that transaction ended — and the reaper scans
#      the whole table, so it meets those locks constantly. `SKIP LOCKED` skips the row
#      instead, which costs nothing: a row someone else holds is by definition a row
#      something is still working on, and if it really is stuck the next pass finds it five
#      minutes later. tests/test_run_reaper.py drives exactly that case with a lock held from
#      a separate connection, because it is the mutation the two-concurrent-reapers test
#      cannot see.
#
# `ORDER BY started_at` puts the longest-stranded runs first, so a pass that hits `LIMIT $3`
# makes progress in a fair order rather than starving the same runs behind newer ones on
# every wake-up — the same argument `SchedulesReader._LOCK_DUE` makes for its own ordering.

#
# Why this exact shape, since none of it is obvious from the SQL alone:
#
# * `per_bucket` aggregates real rows and is THEN left-joined onto `buckets`. The obvious
#   alternative — `FROM buckets LEFT JOIN scoped ... GROUP BY` — makes `count(*)` return 1
#   for an empty bucket, which is the single easiest way to ship a wrong zero-fill.
#   Aggregating first and `COALESCE`-ing after cannot have that bug.
# * `totals` is a separate single-row CTE `CROSS JOIN`ed onto every series row. That returns
#   both response shapes from one query, and a one-row aggregate always produces a row even
#   over zero input, so the series is still fully zero-filled for a website with no runs.
#   Cost is a handful of repeated columns over at most 168 rows.
# * Deliberately NOT `json_agg`. `to_jsonb(timestamptz)` renders using the session
#   `TimeZone`, so bucket timestamps would come back offset-rendered rather than UTC, and
#   asyncpg hands json/jsonb back as `str`, requiring a `json.loads`. Plain columns keep
#   every value a native asyncpg type (`datetime` with `tzinfo=utc`, `int`, `float`).
# * `AS MATERIALIZED` documents the intent: `runs` is scanned once and the result feeds both
#   aggregates. (Postgres already materializes a CTE referenced twice; saying so keeps it
#   true if that ever changes.)
# * `avg(duration_ms)` relies on `AVG` skipping NULLs, so the denominator is completed runs
#   only, while `count(*)` still counts failed and in-flight runs in `runs`/`total_runs`. The
#   outer `COALESCE(..., 0)` fires only when a bucket has zero completed runs. This is the
#   subtlest thing in the query: `avg(pages_crawled)` below counts every in-window run,
#   missing stats as `0`, while `avg(duration_ms)` counts only completed ones. Both are
#   correct for what each one means, but they are not the same population.
# * `jsonb_typeof(...) = 'number'` rather than a bare cast: `stats` is `NULL` for runs that
#   predate the crawler and for runs that failed during fetch, and a non-numeric value would
#   make a bare `::numeric` cast raise. The guard makes the query total over any real data.
# * `date_trunc($5, ..., 'UTC')` — the three-argument form pins bucketing to UTC instead of
#   inheriting the session `TimeZone`.
#
# **PER-193 additions, below the original six bullets rather than folded into them, since
# they are a genuinely different shape of aggregate:**
#
# * `index_pages`/`index_bytes`/`pages_added`/`pages_removed` in `scoped` are all `NULL`,
#   never `0`, when absent — including for a `first_run` `index_diff` block, whose `->
#   'pages_added'` on a missing key is SQL `NULL` by construction, and for a JSON `index_diff:
#   null`, whose `->` into it is also `NULL`. Both conditions therefore fall out of the same
#   `jsonb_typeof(...) = 'number'` guard the original six columns already use, with no extra
#   branching. `AND r.status = 'completed'` is part of every one of the four guards: a
#   `failed` row can carry a fully-populated `index_diff` describing an index that was never
#   persisted (`internals/run_stats.py`'s `build_run_stats` docstring explains why), and this
#   is the filter that keeps such a row out of every PER-193 aggregate.
# * `(array_agg(index_pages ORDER BY started_at DESC, id DESC) FILTER (WHERE index_pages IS
#   NOT NULL))[1]` is "the last completed run in this bucket that recorded an index size" —
#   deliberately not `max()`, which would report the LARGEST index in the bucket rather than
#   the most RECENT one, and the two disagree the moment a site's index shrinks
#   (`tests/test_stats_api.py::test_index_size_is_the_last_completed_run_in_the_bucket_not_the_max`).
#   `array_agg ... FILTER` returns `NULL` (never an empty array) when nothing in the bucket
#   matches, so `[1]` on that is `NULL` too — array indexing a `NULL` array is `NULL` in
#   Postgres, not an error, which is exactly the "unknown, not zero" value this column needs
#   when a bucket has no completed run to ask.
# * **The zero-fill asymmetry is deliberate, and it is the subtlest thing PER-193 added.** The
#   final `SELECT` wraps `runs_compared`/`pages_added`/`pages_removed` in `COALESCE(..., 0)`
#   — real MEASUREMENTS, and an empty bucket measured zero of each — but wraps
#   `index_pages`/`index_bytes` in nothing at all, leaving a `NULL` `NULL`. An empty bucket
#   added zero pages; it does not have an index of size zero, it has no evidence of an index
#   at all. A reviewer "tidying" the second pair to match the first's `COALESCE` breaks the
#   null-vs-zero contract `RunStatsPoint.index_pages` documents, which is what
#   `test_a_bucket_with_no_completed_run_reports_null_index_size_not_zero` exists to catch.
#
# **The curated-`llms.txt` ticket's addition, `RUN_STATS_VERSION` 13:** `index_pages` becomes
# `links_emitted + links_optional`, not `links_emitted` alone, so the tile still means "pages
# in the artifact" now that some of them render under `## Optional` instead of the main body
# (`internals/llms_txt.py`'s `IndexCounts`). The inner `links_optional` guard defaults to `0`
# — a pre-version-13 row simply adds nothing, reporting exactly what it always meant — but that
# `0` stays INSIDE the addition and never leaks to the outer `ELSE NULL`: a bucket with no
# completed run must still report an unknown index size, not a zero one, and wrapping the whole
# expression in the same outer guard the six original columns already use is what keeps that
# contract intact.

        HTTP path. Unscoped by caller for the same reason every other read in this file is
        (ARCHITECTURE.md §4.1): a background job acting on a website has no caller identity to
        scope by in the first place.

        Args:
            website_id: The run's own website.
            before_started_at: The CURRENT run's `started_at` — "previous" means started
                strictly before this instant, tie-broken by id. Always the run this method is
                being asked about on behalf of, never `datetime.now(UTC)`.
            before_run_id: The CURRENT run's own id, the tie-break half of the same keyset
                pair `before_started_at` is the other half of.

        Returns:
            Exactly one row, always — see `_PREVIOUS_COMPLETED_INDEX`'s own comment for why a
            `LEFT JOIN ... ON TRUE` guarantees that. `row["run_id"]` is `None` when there is
            no completed run before this one at all, in which case every other column is also
            `None` and `row["previous_status"]` says whether an INCOMPLETE run exists
            (`"pending"`/`"processing"`/`"failed"`) or there is no earlier run whatsoever
            (`None`).
