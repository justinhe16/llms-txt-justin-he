    Opens three process-wide resources and closes them in reverse: the Postgres pool via
    `open_pool()`, the JWKS cache via `open_jwks_cache()`, and the ARQ Redis pool the API
    enqueues through via `open_queue_pool()`. Each comes from the same factory the ARQ
    worker's startup hook uses (`app.infrastructure.db.pool`, `app.core.auth.jwks`,
    `app.infrastructure.queue.pool`), so the two processes build them identically.
    `close_pool()` awaits `pool.close()` rather than dropping the reference, so in-flight
    connections finish and are released instead of being torn down mid-query.

    **Two of the three are deliberately non-fatal, and which is which is the whole design.**
    Postgres is fatal because nothing works without it. JWKS and Redis are not, because the
    API keeps serving reads without either — see the comments at each call below.

    # Deliberately the OPPOSITE of open_pool()'s fail-fast above, and the contrast is the
    # point. A bad DATABASE_URL breaks every request for the life of the process, so
    # refusing to boot is the honest response. An unreachable JWKS endpoint is recoverable
    # on the very next request — get_key() refetches when it sees an unknown kid — so
    # refusing to boot on it would turn a transient Supabase blip into an outage of our own
    # making. open_jwks_cache() therefore logs loudly and continues with an empty cache
    # instead of raising; see its docstring for the full reasoning. CI proves this path on
    # every run: build-check's SUPABASE_URL does not resolve, so the app it boots and
    # probes has always taken the degraded branch.

    # start a crawl and nothing else: every read endpoint still works. Refusing to boot
    # here would convert an Upstash outage into a total outage, and it would do it at the
    # worst moment, since a deploy is exactly when the app is being restarted anyway.
    #
    # This is the same judgement `/health` encodes by keeping its HTTP status at 200 while
    # reporting `redis` in the body. The two have to agree: an API that refuses to boot
    # without Redis makes a non-fatal health field meaningless.
    #
    # `arq.create_pool` pings before returning and retries `conn_retries` (5) times a
    # second apart first, so this branch costs up to ~5s of startup when Redis is down —
    # which is why `grace_period` in backend/fly.toml is set well above it. `get_pool()`
