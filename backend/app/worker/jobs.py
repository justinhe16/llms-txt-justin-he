"""ARQ job functions.

Thin by contract (ARCHITECTURE.md §3.3): a job parses its typed arguments, calls one
service method, and returns. Jobs are enqueued with ids and primitives only — never ORM
objects, never Pydantic models — because everything on the queue is serialized and has to
survive a deploy that changes those classes.

**`crawl_task` lives here, not in `app/features/crawl/task.py`.** The ticket that added it
said the latter; ARCHITECTURE.md §3.3 says "Job functions live in `backend/app/worker/`" and
lists `worker/jobs.py` as "the job functions themselves" — and per CLAUDE.md, the document
wins over a ticket that contradicts it. The task itself stays exactly as thin as `noop`
below: coerce the id, pull the two resources it needs off `ctx`, call one service method,
log, and return. Every real decision — the idempotency claim, the network call, the
sanitized failure message — lives in `app.features.crawl.service.CrawlService`.

`crawl_task`'s public signature is exactly `async def crawl_task(ctx, run_id)`. A sibling
ticket enqueues it **by name** — arq registers a bare coroutine under its `__qualname__`
(`arq.worker.func`), so `"crawl_task"` is the registered name regardless of which module it
lives in. Do not rename it, wrap it in `arq.worker.func(..., name=...)`, or add a required
parameter.

`run_id` arrives as a `str`, not a `UUID`: arq serializes job arguments with msgpack, which a
`UUID` does not survive, and ARCHITECTURE.md §3.3 says jobs take "ids and primitives" for
exactly this reason. `crawl_task` accepts `str | UUID` and coerces with `UUID(str(run_id))`;
a malformed id is logged and the job returns rather than raising.

**"A worker must not raise at arq" now has exactly one exception, and PER-166 added it
deliberately.** `crawl_task` raises `arq.worker.Retry` — and only that — when
`CrawlService` reports a transient failure with attempts left on the run's budget. The old
contract was written when a raise had nowhere useful to go: arq 0.28 retries only on `Retry`,
`RetryJob`, and `CancelledError`, and turns every other exception into a terminal job
failure, so raising an application error at arq really would have accomplished nothing but a
noisier log. Asking for a redelivery is the one thing a raise can accomplish, and it is the
one thing this file raises for. Every other failure — a bad `run_id`, a missing run, a lost
claim race, a permanent crawl failure, an exhausted retry budget — is still logged and
returned as a string.

**The retry policy lives in `app/worker/policy.py`, and the number of attempts lives in the
database.** `runs.attempts`, incremented by the claim, is what decides whether there is
budget left; `policy.retry_delay_seconds` turns that number into a backoff. Neither is
`ctx["job_try"]`, which counts deliveries of one arq job id and resets whenever the reaper
re-enqueues a run under a new one.

**Each job binds its own correlation id, and that is the one thing a job does that is not
"call one service method".** `crawl_task` opens `run_id_context(...)` around its body and
`schedule_tick` opens `tick_id_context(...)` around its; both are `contextvar` scopes
(`app.core.logging`), so every line logged anywhere beneath them — in `CrawlService`, in
`internals/fetcher.py`, in `internals/ssrf.py` — carries the id automatically, with no
function in between having to accept one. It belongs here, in the job, rather than in the
service, because the job is the outermost thing that knows which run this is: a service
method called from a route would have no run to bind, and binding it twice at different
depths is how a correlation id starts disagreeing with itself.

**`schedule_tick` is the second job, and it takes no arguments beyond `ctx`.** It is not
enqueued by anything — arq's own cron scheduler calls it once a minute (`app/worker/
settings.py`'s `cron_jobs`), which is what makes it a cron job rather than a task something
else enqueues. It builds a `ScheduleService` from `ctx["db_pool"]` and the module `settings`
and calls `ScheduleService.run_due_schedules`, exactly as thin as `crawl_task` above.

**`reaper_tick` is the third, and the second cron job.** Same shape as `schedule_tick`, a
different cadence (every five minutes) and a different service method
(`RunService.reap_stuck_runs`). Both bind `tick_id_context`; see `reaper_tick`'s own
docstring for why they share that contextvar rather than introducing a second one.

    Named `noop` rather than `ping` on purpose: it shares a log stream with redis-py's own
    `PING` traffic and with `GET /health`'s Redis probe, and three different things called
    "ping" in one log is a bad half-hour for whoever is reading it at the time.

    **This is not filler, and it should not be deleted when the crawl task lands.** It
    exists for two reasons:

    1. **arq refuses to start with an empty function list.** `arq.worker.Worker.__init__`
       raises `RuntimeError('at least one function or cron_job must be registered')` before
       it ever connects to Redis. A `WorkerSettings` with `functions = []` therefore does
       not idle harmlessly waiting for its first real job — it crashes on boot, and Fly
       restarts it in a loop that is easy to miss because nothing is serving HTTP to fail.
    2. **It is the only way to verify the queue without the crawl task.** "A job enqueued
       from the API is picked up by the worker within ~5s" is an acceptance criterion of
       the ticket that introduced this file, and `poll_delay` is a setting whose regression
       is otherwise silent. Enqueue this, watch the worker log it, and both the Redis wiring
       and the poll interval have been observed rather than assumed.

    It touches nothing: no database, no network beyond the Redis round trip arq already
    made to deliver it. `ctx` carries the shared resources `on_startup` put there
    (`ctx["db_pool"]`) plus arq's own `ctx["redis"]`, and this job deliberately uses
    neither — a probe that can fail for a second reason is a worse probe.

    Returns:
        A short string, which arq stores as the job result under `keep_result` (1 hour by
        default). `Job.result()` returning it is the API-side half of the round trip.

    """Crawl the website behind `run_id`. Thin by contract — see the module docstring.

    `ctx["db_pool"]`, `ctx["http_client"]`, and `ctx["storage"]` are all published once per
    process by `app/worker/settings.py`'s `open_worker_resources`, the same pattern `noop`
    documents for `ctx["db_pool"]` alone. This job builds a fresh `CrawlService` from them on
    every call — the service itself is cheap to construct (see `build_crawl_service`) —
    rather than caching one on `ctx`, so a service's dependencies are exactly what
    `app.features.crawl.service.build_crawl_service`'s signature says they are, with
    nothing smuggled in through job-to-job state.

    `ctx.get("anthropic_client")`, not `ctx["anthropic_client"]` — the one resource read with
    `.get` rather than a bare subscript, because absence here means "the flag is off" for
    every deployment and every test that does not opt in, not "the context was built wrong."
    `open_worker_resources` only sets this key at all when `settings.crawl_enrich_with_llm`
    is `True` (PER-180), so `.get` returning `None` is the ordinary, expected case rather
    than a defensive fallback for a misconfigured `ctx`.

    Args:
        ctx: arq's job context. Must already carry `"db_pool"`, `"http_client"`, and
            `"storage"` — true for any job this `WorkerSettings` runs, and never true in a
            plain unit test constructing this function's arguments by hand. May also carry
            `"anthropic_client"`, present only when `settings.crawl_enrich_with_llm` is on.
        run_id: The run to crawl, as arq's msgpack serialization actually delivers it — see
            the module docstring for why that is a `str` rather than a `UUID` in practice,
            and why the parameter still accepts either.

    Returns:
        A short, human-readable outcome string for arq's job result — never anything a
        caller is expected to parse. A bad `run_id`, a missing run, a lost claim race, and a
        terminally failed crawl (including a failed Storage upload or database write) are all
        logged and returned rather than raised.

    Raises:
        arq.worker.Retry: the one deliberate exception to "a worker must not raise at arq" —
            see the module docstring. The run is already back in `pending` when this is
            raised, so the redelivered job has something to claim.
        asyncio.CancelledError: arq's job timeout, or SIGTERM. Not caught here.
            `CrawlService.execute_run` catches it one layer down, hands the run back to the
            queue (or fails it, if the budget is spent), and re-raises — so by the time it
            reaches this frame the database already reflects what happened.

            Whether arq then redelivers depends on WHICH cancellation it was, and only
            SIGTERM is redelivered: it cancels `run_job`'s own frame, so arq sees
            `CancelledError` and re-queues. A `job_timeout` cancels the inner task, and
            `asyncio.wait_for` hands arq a `TimeoutError` instead, which is not in its retry
            set — that run waits for the reaper's orphan sweep. See
            `CrawlService.execute_run`'s docstring for the full argument, and
