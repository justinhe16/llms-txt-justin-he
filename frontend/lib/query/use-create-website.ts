/**
 * `POST /websites`. Every call invalidates `queryKeys.websites.all` on success — every
 * website list currently mounted (with or without `?include=latest_run`) refetches to
 * pick up the new row — and surfaces a failure as a `sonner` toast built from
 * `error.message`, which is where `lib/api/fetcher.ts`'s `ApiError` puts the backend's own
 * wording (a `409` reads "you already have this website" instead of "Request failed with
 * status 409" — see that file's `extractErrorMessage`).
 *
 * `options` lets a caller add its own `onSuccess`/`onError` — a page that wants to
 * navigate on success, say, or the `409` handling `lib/api/errors.ts`'s
 * `isWebsiteAlreadyExists` exists for — **without** losing either behavior above: both
 * run, this hook's always first, so the invalidation and the toast have already happened
 * by the time a caller's own callback sees the result.
 *
 * `toastOnError` is the one part of that a caller may switch off. It defaults to `true`, so
 * nothing about an existing call site changes; the landing page passes `false` because it
 * renders the failure *under the field that caused it* rather than in a corner of the
 * screen, and a toast saying the same thing twice is noise. The invalidation is not
 * optional in the same way — it is correctness, not presentation.
