// Presentation helpers for `GET /websites/{id}/stats`, as the detail page's Trends tab
// renders it. Pure functions over the response — no clock is read in here and no React is
// imported, for the same reason `relative-time.ts` next door avoids both: everything below is
// callable from a render pass and answerable on its own (ARCHITECTURE.md §8.4).
//
// The neighbouring `run-display.ts` formats ONE run for a table cell; this file folds MANY
// runs into the shapes the Trends tab's tiles and charts read.
//
// As of PER-193 the tab reports on the ARTIFACT — index size, pages added/removed/changed —
// rather than on the crawler's own timing, and `msToSeconds`/`avg_duration_ms`/`avg_pages` are
// no longer part of that story. The API keeps both fields (removing a response field is a
// breaking change with no user-visible benefit), but nothing under `components/crawls/`
// reads either any more — `TrendsHealthRow` (trends-stat-tiles.tsx), the health summary that
// replaces the old duration/pages tiles, is one line of `total_runs`/`success_rate` and
// touches neither. Do not reintroduce a duration helper here on the strength of "this file
// used to have one" — the ticket's acceptance criteria are explicit that run duration is
// demoted out of the panel entirely.

// EVERY formatter below is pinned to UTC, and that is a correctness decision rather than a
// stylistic one.
//
// The backend buckets on `date_trunc($5, r.started_at, 'UTC')` (runs_reader.py), so a `day`
// bucket is a UTC day and an `hour` bucket is a UTC hour. Rendering the bucket that starts at
// 2026-08-05T00:00:00Z in, say, America/Los_Angeles would label it "Aug 4, 5:00 PM" — a
// bucket that contains only runs from August 5th, displayed under August 4th. The axis would
// be off by one day for most of the world, and nothing about the chart would look wrong.
//
// So the labels say what the buckets are, and the panel prints "times in UTC" once so the
// reader knows which clock they are reading. This is the one place in the app that departs
// from `relative-time.ts`'s browser-local `formatAbsoluteTime`, which is right for its own
// job: a run's `started_at` is an instant, and an instant is best shown in the reader's own
// time. A bucket is not an instant — it is a labelled UTC interval.
//
// The locale is pinned to "en-US" for the same reason, plus one more: an axis tick's width
// has to be predictable enough to lay out, and "whatever the browser is set to" would render
// a timezone that is not the reader's in a format that is. The app has no i18n; when it gets
// one, these four formatters are what change.
