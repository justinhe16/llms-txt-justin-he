// Named, feature-level wrappers around `api` (lib/api/fetcher.ts) for `/websites/{id}/runs`
// and `/runs/{id}`. Every call site in the app — a page, a component, a React Query hook in
// `lib/query/` — should import from here rather than reaching for `api.get` directly, so the
// endpoint list in this file, together with lib/api/websites.ts, lib/api/schedules.ts, and
// lib/api/health.ts, is the entire inventory of what the frontend can ask the backend for.
//
// `triggerRun` (`POST /websites/{id}/runs`) is no longer on the absent list: PER-160 shipped
// the route, and PER-162's "Run now" button is the caller that needed it. It is the only
// WRITE in this file — the two reads above it are unfiltered by caller identity, this one is
// owner-only, and the four error shapes it can return are the reason `RunAlreadyInFlightDetail`
// and `RunLimitExceededDetail` are exported below.
//
// `getStats` (`GET /websites/{id}/stats`) is no longer absent either: PER-156 shipped the
// route on backend/app/api/routers/runs.py alongside the two reads above, and PER-169's
// Trends tab is the caller that needed it. It lives in THIS file rather than
// lib/api/websites.ts despite its `/websites/…` path, for the same reason the backend put
// the route on its runs router: what it returns is run statistics — counts, durations and
// page averages of runs — and the website id in the path is only the scope. Schedules are
// not on the list at all: `GET`/`PUT /websites/{id}/schedule` shipped with PER-154 and live
// in `lib/api/schedules.ts` — the schedules feature owns its own response shapes, the same
// way this file owns `RunListItemResponse` and friends.
//
// `getLlmsTxt` (`GET /runs/{id}/llms.txt`) and `getLlmsFullTxt` (`GET /runs/{id}/llms-full.txt`)
// round out the pair PER-181 shipped alongside `getRun` above: each downloads one of a run's
// two artifacts as `text/plain` rather than a JSON body, which is exactly the case
// `lib/api/fetcher.ts`'s `SuccessBodyOf` grew a second branch for, so `api.get` still resolves
// each call to `Promise<string>` instead of silently to `Promise<void>`. PER-182's "Download
// full" button (`components/crawls/download-full-button.tsx`, via
// `lib/crawls/use-download-full-artifact.ts`) is the caller that needed `getLlmsFullTxt`.
// `getLlmsTxt` has no caller yet — the Output tab's existing Download button already holds
// `llms_txt` in memory from `GET /runs/{id}` and builds its `Blob` from that, with no request
// of its own — and it is listed here honestly rather than pretending otherwise, because this
// file's inventory of what the frontend can ask `/runs/{id}/…` for is meant to be complete.
//
// Nothing is on the absent list any more. When the next endpoint lands, add its helper here
// or in the sibling file that owns its feature — never a hand-written response shape, and
// never a path `paths` does not know about, which `PathsWithMethod` in fetcher.ts turns into
// a compile error rather than a runtime 404.
