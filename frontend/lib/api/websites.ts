// Named, feature-level wrappers around `api` (lib/api/fetcher.ts) for `/websites`. Every
// call site in the app — a page, a component, a React Query hook in `lib/query/` — should
// import from here rather than reaching for `api.get`/`api.post`/`api.patch`/`api.delete`
// directly, so the endpoint list in this file, together with `lib/api/runs.ts`,
// `lib/api/schedules.ts`, and `lib/api/health.ts`, is the entire inventory of what the
// frontend can ask the backend for.
//
// Read helpers for `GET /websites/{id}/runs` and `GET /runs/{id}` live in `lib/api/runs.ts`,
// and `GET`/`PUT /websites/{id}/schedule` live in `lib/api/schedules.ts` — not here. Each
// feature owns its own response shapes, the same way this file owns `WebsiteResponse` and
// friends. `POST /websites/{id}/runs` (PER-160) and `GET /websites/{id}/stats` (PER-156)
// both live in `lib/api/runs.ts` as `triggerRun` and `getStats`, despite their `/websites/…`
// paths — they are a run and run statistics respectively, and the backend files them on its
// own runs router for that same reason. `PATCH /websites/{id}` (PER-194) is the second write
// on this router, alongside `DELETE` — `updateWebsite` below. Nothing on the `/websites`
// surface is absent from this file today.

// under the name `Schedule`. Two exports named `Schedule` for two different shapes is
// exactly the drift this ticket's typed-client discipline exists to prevent — the OpenAPI
// schema itself draws this line (`ScheduleSummary` vs. `ScheduleResponse`), and this alias
// keeps that distinction visible at the call site instead of erasing it for brevity.
