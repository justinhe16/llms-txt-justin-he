// browser, against the page's own origin (`app/api/[...path]/route.ts`); calling it
// server-side would resolve nowhere meaningful. Server code that needs the API talks to
// API_URL directly instead of importing this module.
//
// This file has two halves. `apiFetch<T>` below is the low-level primitive — a caller
// supplies `T` positionally and gets no help from the compiler if it is wrong. The typed
// client at the bottom of this file (search "Typed client") is what every feature-level
// helper (lib/api/websites.ts and friends) should call instead: it derives `T`, the
// request body, and every parameter from the generated `paths` type in `./schema`
// (openapi-typescript, regenerated from the backend's own OpenAPI document — see
// scripts/export-openapi.sh), so an endpoint's shape is declared exactly once. `apiFetch`
// itself stays exported and unchanged for the rare caller that has no `paths` entry to
// lean on (there is none today, but the seam should not disappear).

//
// Everything below builds `api.get`/`api.post`/`api.put`/`api.patch`/`api.delete` on top of
// `apiFetch` above.
// The type-level goal is that an endpoint's request and response shapes are declared
// exactly once, in the backend's Pydantic models — `paths` (openapi-typescript's output
// in `./schema.d.ts`, regenerated from `./openapi.json` by `npm run gen:api`) is the
// single downstream copy, and every call site reads its types from it rather than
// re-declaring them. `frontend/lib/api/schema.type-test.ts` is where that promise is
// checked at compile time: a call with an unknown path, a wrong param type, or a wrong
// body type must fail to build.
//
// This section is deliberately self-contained: nothing above it needs to know a `paths`
// type exists, and nothing outside it should reach into these type helpers directly —
// `lib/api/websites.ts` and friends are the intended call sites, via the exported `api`
// object at the bottom.

// The five verbs every current caller needs. PUT landed with the schedules ticket
// (`PUT /websites/{id}/schedule` upserts a website's schedule); PATCH landed with PER-194
// (`PATCH /websites/{id}` changes one column at a time). Widening this list further means
// adding the verb here once, plus one more method on the `api` object below — everything
// else generalizes over it already.
type HttpMethod = "get" | "post" | "put" | "patch" | "delete";

// every unused method on every path as `{ verb?: never }`, so filtering on "does this
// path's `M` resolve to something other than `never`" is what turns `paths` (which has an
// entry, technically, for every verb on every path) into "the paths you can actually call
// this way" — this is also what makes `api.get("/nope")` a compile error rather than a
// runtime 404: "/nope" is not a member of `PathsWithMethod<"get">` at all.
//
// The `infer Op` here has to happen inside a *structural* match (`paths[P] extends { [K in
// M]: infer Op }`), not a bare indexed access (`paths[P][M]`): indexed access on an
// optional property adds `| undefined` to an otherwise-`never` type, and `never |
