// This file is never imported at runtime — nothing in the app reaches for it, and it does

// already do, and which `make lint` and `.github/workflows/ci-frontend.yml` already run.
// There is no vitest/jest in this repo — adding one is a cross-cutting tooling decision
// that deserves its own ticket — so this is the only place the claims this ticket makes
// about the typed client (lib/api/fetcher.ts) are checked at all.
//
// Every `@ts-expect-error` below is an assertion, not a suppression, and is the *opposite*
// of the `@ts-ignore` this repo bans (CLAUDE.md): `@ts-expect-error` fails the build if the
// very next line does NOT produce an error, so each one records "this must never compile"
// rather than silencing something that currently does. If a schema change ever makes one
// of these calls valid again — a path un-deleted, a field's type widened back — that is a
// real regression in what the generic client rejects, and this file is what turns it into
// a build failure instead of a silent behavior change.
