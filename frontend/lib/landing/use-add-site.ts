/**
 * The landing page's submit flow: validate, create the website, start its first run, and

 *
 * ## Why both requests complete before the navigation
 *
 * Navigating optimistically after the `201` would land on `/crawls/{id}` with an empty Runs
 * tab and a run that appears a beat later, which reads as a broken page rather than a fast
 * one. The wait is real, which is why the field renders a spinner and stays disabled across
 * both requests.
 *
 * ## The five endings
 *
 * | outcome | what happens |
 * | --- | --- |
 * | `201` then `202` | navigate to `/crawls/{id}` — the ordinary path |
 * | `409` from `POST /websites` | navigate to the website already in the body. Pasting a URL you already added should take you to it, not error. |
 * | `409` from `POST /websites/{id}/runs` | navigate anyway — the run already in flight is the one they want to watch |
 * | `429` | stay, and render the backend's cap message inline, verbatim |
 * | `503` / `5xx` / network | stay, render the message, offer a retry — and, when the site was already created, a link to it |
 *
 * The `503` case is the one worth stating: the queue could not be reached, and
 * `RunService.abandon_unqueued_run` has already marked the row `failed` before answering. So
 * there is no run in flight to go and watch — sending the user to a detail page to look at a
 * run that never started would be worse than saying so here and offering a retry that can
 * actually work.
 *
 * Both mutations run with `toastOnError: false`. Every message here belongs under the field
 * that produced it — and on the two `409` paths there is no failure to report at all, only a
 * navigation.
