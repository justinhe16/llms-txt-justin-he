/**
 * `/crawls` — every website in the system, one row each.
 *
 * Every signed-in user sees every website here, regardless of who added it. That is
 * ARCHITECTURE.md §4.1's read rule showing through to the UI, not an oversight: this
 * application is not multi-tenant, `GET /websites` does not filter by `user_id`, and the
 * Owner column exists precisely because the list is shared. Ownership decides what you can
 * *change*, on the detail page; it decides nothing about what you can see.
 *
 * No auth check in this component. `frontend/middleware.ts` gates `/crawls` server-side
 * before anything here renders, which is the only place route protection is allowed to live
 * (ARCHITECTURE.md §8.2) — a second check here would be both redundant and, being
 * client-visible, not actually a check.
 *
 * A server component holding three client islands (`CrawlsHeader`'s own `UserMenu`,
 * `CrawlsView`, and `CrawlsGithubConnectToast` below). It fetches nothing itself: the table's
 * data arrives through React Query in the browser (see `CrawlsView`), which is what lets the
 * same query poll, dedupe and cache without this page re-rendering on the server every three
 * seconds.
