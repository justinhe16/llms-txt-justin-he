/**
 * How MDX renders into this design system.
 *
 * The file has to live at the project root with exactly this name and this export — that is
 * `@next/mdx`'s contract for the App Router, not a choice made here — which is also why it
 * is the one component file outside `components/`.
 *
 * Every element is styled explicitly rather than through a typography plugin. There is one
 * MDX page in this application, `@tailwindcss/typography` is not installed, and a plugin
 * would bring its own opinions about colour — including a `prose-invert` dark variant this
 * repository does not have and must not grow (CLAUDE.md rule 7). A dozen-odd element styles
 * that name the palette's own tokens are smaller than that and cannot drift from it.
