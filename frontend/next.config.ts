// One rehype plugin. `rehype-slug` gives every heading in `app/docs/page.mdx` a
// deterministic `id` derived from its text by `github-slugger`, so `## Discovery` renders as
// `<h2 id="discovery">`. The diagram in the left column of `/docs` scrolls to those ids, and
// `lib/docs/sections.ts` names them; deriving the slug in `mdx-components.tsx` instead would
// mean reimplementing that slugger and keeping it in step with nothing.
//
// Still no syntax highlighting, and still no heading-anchor plugin: this page has neither a
// code sample worth colouring nor a table of contents to link into. The diagram is the table
// of contents.
//
// Named as a STRING rather than imported. Next transpiles this config to CommonJS before it
// loads it, and `rehype-slug` is ESM-only ("type": "module") — so an `import` here becomes a
// `require()` of an ESM module, which only works through Node's `require(esm)` bridge on
// Node >= 20.19. CI pins `node-version: 20`, so that would be a build that passes on a
// laptop and depends on the runner's patch version. `@next/mdx` resolves the string with a
// real dynamic `import()` inside webpack instead, and types it (`string | [name, options] |
// Pluggable`), so the risk goes away rather than being bet on.
