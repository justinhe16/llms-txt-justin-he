 *
 * ## Visible to everyone, enabled for one person
 *
 * A non-owner sees the button disabled with a tooltip naming who can use it, rather than
 * not seeing it at all. This app is deliberately not multi-tenant (ARCHITECTURE.md §4):
 * every signed-in user can read every website, so "why can't I run this" is a question a
 * non-owner will genuinely have, and a missing control answers it worse than a disabled one.
 *
 * The gate is UI only, and is not what actually protects the endpoint — `require_owner` in
 * the service does that, and returns `403` regardless of what this component renders.
 *
 * ## Three reasons the button is disabled, and they are not interchangeable
 *
 * Not the owner, a run is already going, and a request is in flight all disable it, but each
 * says something different and the tooltip says which. A single "disabled" with no
 * explanation is the version of this control that generates support questions.
 *
 * A disabled `<button>` fires no pointer events, so Radix's tooltip would never open on
 * one — hence the `<span>` wrapper that carries the trigger. That is the standard workaround
 * and the reason the markup is shaped this way rather than putting the trigger on the button
 * itself.
