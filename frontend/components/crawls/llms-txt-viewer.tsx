/**
 * The `llms.txt` artifact itself: line numbers, a copy button, a download button, and
 * horizontal scrolling that stays inside the viewer.
 *
 * ## Why this is two `<pre>` elements and not 5,000 `<div>`s
 *
 * The ticket's constraint is that a large artifact must not jank the page, and offers
 * "virtualize or cap the rendered height" as the two ways out. This does something simpler
 * and strictly better than either: it renders the whole document as exactly **two text
 * nodes** — one for the gutter, one for the code — inside a fixed-height scroll container.
 *
 * The jank a 5,000-line artifact causes is not the browser struggling with text; browsers
 * lay out large `<pre>` blocks very well. It is React reconciling 5,000 elements and the
 * style/layout cost of the DOM nodes behind them. Emitting the lines as one string removes
 * that cost entirely rather than deferring it, and the node count is O(1) in the size of
 * the file — a 50,000-line artifact renders exactly as fast as a 5-line one.
 *
 * It also avoids what virtualization would have cost here: a windowing library (a
 * dependency this repo does not have), a measured row height that breaks the moment a line
 * wraps, and a `Ctrl+F` that only searches the visible window. Native text search works
 * over this viewer because the whole document is really in the DOM.
 *
 * The gutter and the code are aligned by nothing more than a shared `leading-5` — two
 * `<pre>`s in the same font and the same line-height have the same baselines. The gutter is
 * `sticky left-0` so it stays put while the code scrolls horizontally under it.
