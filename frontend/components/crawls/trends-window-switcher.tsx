 * The 12h / 1d / 3d selector above the Trends panel.
 *
 * ## Buttons with `aria-pressed`, not a `<Tabs>` and not a `<select>`
 *
 * Three short, always-visible options that change one view is exactly a toggle group. A
 * second `<Tabs>` nested inside the page's tabs would put two tablists on one screen and make
 * "which tab am I on" ambiguous to a screen reader; a `<select>` hides two of three choices
 * behind a click for no gain at this size.
 *
 * `aria-pressed` rather than `aria-current` because these are toggle buttons, not links to
 * places. The `<div role="group">` with an `aria-label` is what makes the three announce as
 * one control instead of three unrelated buttons that happen to sit together.
 *
 * ## No local state
 *
 * The selected window lives in the URL (`lib/crawls/use-detail-view.ts`), so this component
 * is fully controlled and holds nothing of its own. That is what makes
 * `?tab=trends&window=3d` restore this control's position on load without any effect
 * synchronising a `useState` back to the query string.
