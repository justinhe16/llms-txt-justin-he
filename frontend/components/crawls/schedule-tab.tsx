 * The Schedule tab — `GET`/`PUT /websites/{id}/schedule`.
 *
 * ## The query lives here, not in `WebsiteDetail`
 *
 * `WebsiteDetail` hoists the run history because three of its children need the same list.
 * Nothing outside this panel reads the schedule, so hoisting it would move a request away
 * from its only consumer for no benefit — the same reasoning that keeps `GET /runs/{id}`
 * inside the Output tab. Radix mounts only the active tab's content, so this request is not
 * made at all until someone opens the tab.
 *
 * The one thing that *is* passed down is `latestRun`. "Last run … completed" needs a status,
 * and `ScheduleResponse` has only `last_run_at` with no status beside it — so the status has
 * to come from the run history the page has already fetched. Issuing a second runs query here
 * would not just be wasteful, it could disagree with the status in the page header.
 *
 * ## `null` is a state, not an error
 *
 * `GET` answers `200` with a `null` body for a website that has never had a schedule. That is
 * "off, daily preselected" (see `scheduleToDraft`), which is what lets a first-time enable be
 * a single click — the alternative, an empty panel with a "Create schedule" button, makes the
 * user perform a setup step that carries no information.
