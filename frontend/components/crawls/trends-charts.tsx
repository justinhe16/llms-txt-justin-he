// Colour
// ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
//
// Every colour below is a `var(--…)` reading a custom property declared in `:root` by
// app/globals.css — never a Tailwind utility, and never a class name assembled at runtime.
//
// That is not a style preference, it is the only spelling that works in both directions
// here. Recharts paints SVG through `fill`/`stroke` attributes, which take colour values and
// not class names, so a utility would have to be resolved to a value anyway. And the runtime-
// assembled alternative (`` `bg-status-${token}` ``, the mistake run-status-indicator.tsx
// documents at length) fails silently: Tailwind builds its stylesheet by scanning source
// files for literal class strings, so a name that only ever exists as a template literal is
// simply absent from the compiled CSS and the element paints transparent — invisible to tsc,
// to eslint and to `next build`. `:root` custom properties have no such failure mode; that
// block is plain CSS and is emitted whole, whether or not anything references it.
//
// The two status colours are the SAME tokens the dots, badges and error surfaces use
// (`--status-completed`, `--status-failed`), so a red segment in this chart means exactly
// what a red dot means in the Runs table. Recolouring a status stays a one-line edit in
// globals.css, and this file is not an exception to it.
//
// PER-193's `ChangeChart` extends this rather than starting a second convention: its `added`
// series reuses `--status-completed` and its `removedNegative` series reuses `--status-failed`
// — the same green/red the outcome bar below already means "succeeded" and "failed" with, now
// carrying "grew" and "shrank" instead. One reader learns one meaning for each colour across
// the whole panel rather than two unrelated ones.
