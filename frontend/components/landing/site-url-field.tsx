 * ## The signed-out state is a real `disabled` input, plus a button on top of it
 *
 * The field is genuinely `disabled` — assistive technology is told so, and the design
 * system's `disabled:` styling applies — which also means `disabled:pointer-events-none`
 * swallows every click on it. That is why the transparent button sits above it rather than
 * an `onClick` sitting on the input: the natural first action on this page is to click the
 * field, and doing nothing is a dead end. The overlay is a real, focusable, labelled button,
 * so the keyboard path to sign-in is the same as the mouse path.
 *
 * Nothing here is themed with a `dark:` variant (CLAUDE.md rule 7); the disabled and focus
 * treatments both come from `components/ui/input.tsx`'s own tokens.
