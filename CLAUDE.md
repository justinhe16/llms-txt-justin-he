# CLAUDE.md — llms-text

Rules for working in this repo. **Read [`ARCHITECTURE.md`](./ARCHITECTURE.md) first** — it is
the engineering contract, and it wins over any ticket that contradicts it. This file is not a
summary of that document; it is the short list of rules that are most expensive to get wrong.

**Stack:** Next.js App Router on Vercel · FastAPI + ARQ worker on Fly.io (one image, two
processes) · Supabase Postgres / Auth / Storage · Prisma for schema and migrations only ·
asyncpg at runtime.

## Non-negotiables

**1. Never commit a secret.** This repository is **public** and its history is permanent.
Never commit a private key, API key, service-role key, token, or a connection string
containing credentials — in any commit, on any branch, ever. `.env.example` holds
placeholders only; `.env` and `.env.local` are gitignored and stay that way. Never echo or
log a secret value in code, a script, or a CI step (no `echo $DATABASE_URL`, no dumping the
settings object). Never paste one into a PR description, an issue, or a review comment.
**If a secret is ever committed, rotating it is mandatory — deleting it in a later commit is
not sufficient.** This rule is first because it is the only one on this list that cannot be
undone. Full policy: [ARCHITECTURE.md §9](./ARCHITECTURE.md#9-secrets-hygiene).

**2. Never run a migration by hand, and never run `prisma db push`.** `db/schema.prisma` is
the only source of truth. Author migrations with `prisma migrate dev --create-only`, read the
generated SQL, and commit it alongside the schema change. CI applies it with
`prisma migrate deploy`. Never hand-apply SQL to production — not through `psql`, not through
the Supabase SQL editor. Never edit a migration that has already been applied; write a new
one.

**3. Never deploy from a laptop.** Merging to `main` with green CI is the only path to
production. No `fly deploy`, no `vercel --prod` — a local deploy bypasses CI and can leave
production on a migration revision that no longer exists in the repo.

**4. Reads are unscoped; writes are ownership-checked.** This project is **not
multi-tenant**. Read endpoints require a valid JWT and **do not** filter by `user_id` — every
signed-in user can read every website and every run. Do not "helpfully" add
`WHERE user_id = $1` to a read query. Writes require a valid JWT **and** ownership, checked
by `require_owner(resource, user_id)` in the service method as soon as the resource is
fetched — before any mutation, before any transaction, before any external call. Non-owners
get `403`. There is no `tenant_id` in this codebase and no ticket adds one.

**5. Transactions live in the service layer; writers do not commit.** A service opens an
async `transaction()` that commits on success and rolls back on any exception. A writer
executes its statement and returns — it never commits, never rolls back, never opens a
transaction. **External calls happen outside transactions:** do the Storage upload or HTTP
fetch first, then open a short transaction to record the result. Never hold a database
transaction open across a network call.

**6. Routers are thin.** A route handler parses input, calls one service method, and returns
the response. No business logic, no SQL, no `pool.execute` in a router. All `SELECT`s live in
the feature's reader; all `INSERT`/`UPDATE`/`DELETE` in its writer.

**7. Light theme only.** Do not install `next-themes`. Do not write `dark:` variants
anywhere. Do not add a theme toggle or a `prefers-color-scheme` query. Dark mode is a
designed feature with its own ticket, not something that accumulates one class at a time.

**8. The browser never calls Fly, and the frontend never touches the database.** All frontend
requests go through the Next.js route handlers under `app/api/[...path]/`, which proxy to
FastAPI server-side. There is **no CORS configuration in this repo** — if you are adding CORS
headers, you have accidentally called the API from the client. `API_URL` is server-only and
must never be prefixed `NEXT_PUBLIC_`.

**9. Artifact generation lives behind one pair of functions, and calls no model.** Everything
downstream of a fetched page stays behind one seam:

```python
def generate_llms_txt(                                       # the llms.txt index
    pages: list[CrawledPage], *, site_url: str
) -> str:
    ...

def generate_llms_full_txt(                                  # the llms-full.txt expansion
    pages: list[CrawledPage], *, site_url: str
) -> str:
    ...
```

They live in `backend/app/features/crawl/internals/llms_txt.py`. **They are no longer stubs**
— PER-179 replaced the placeholder with the real llmstxt.org format — but they are still
pure, deterministic and **model-free**, and that last part is a rule rather than a status
report: the model-assisted pass is a layer *above* these functions, and this deterministic
path is the fallback it degrades to when its flag is off or its API call fails. Nothing in
this module may grow a network call. `CrawledPage`, not `Page` — `app.core.pagination.Page`
is already taken (ARCHITECTURE.md §3.4).

Build against those signatures, and do not widen them without a ticket that redesigns the
seam. Do not scatter crawling, parsing, or LLM-calling logic through the services.

**10. Publishing to GitHub may never fail a run, and never stores a credential.** Two
rules, both cheap to break and expensive to discover.

*A publication is a delivery step, not part of the run.* By the time it happens the artifact
is generated, uploaded and committed to `runs.llms_txt` — so the call lives in
`app/worker/jobs.py`'s `crawl_task` **after** `CrawlService.execute_run` returns, never inside
it, and `PublishService.publish_run` never raises. It records a `failed` publication row
instead. Do not move that call into the crawl service, do not let it raise, and do not make a
publication failure change a run's status: that would replace a user's good `llms.txt` with no
`llms.txt` at all.

*No token, refresh token, or key is ever written to the database.* `github_installations`
stores an installation id and an account name. An installation access token is minted from
`GITHUB_APP_PRIVATE_KEY` on demand, held in memory, and left to expire — never persisted,
never logged, never put in a URL (`Authorization` header only). If you find yourself adding a
`token` column, the design has gone wrong; ARCHITECTURE.md §3.9 is the argument.

**`site_url` was that redesign, and it is the only parameter either function gets that is
not a fetched page.** The seam originally took `pages` alone and derived the origin it was
describing from them — `min(page.url for page in pages)`, the alphabetically first URL the
run collected. That held only while every page shared an origin, which is true of what the
crawler *requests* and false of what it *collects*: `CrawledPage.url` is the final url after
redirects, so one page answering from another host renamed the whole document. It titled
Anthropic's artifact `# https://claude.com` off a single redirected page out of a hundred.
An origin the artifact is *given* cannot be outvoted by the pages it lists; an origin it
*derives* can. Do not re-derive it, and do not add a second way to pass it.

## Where things go

```
frontend/                       Next.js App Router → Vercel
frontend/lib/api/               generated OpenAPI types + the typed client — never hand-write a request/response shape
frontend/lib/query/             React Query key factory, polling rules, and hooks (ARCHITECTURE.md §8.6)
backend/app/api/routers/        thin HTTP handlers
backend/app/core/auth/          JWKS cache, JWT verification dependencies, require_owner
backend/app/features/<name>/    schemas.py, service.py, internals/{<name>_reader,<name>_writer}.py
                                websites/ is the reference implementation — read it first
backend/app/infrastructure/db/  asyncpg pool factory, base Reader/Writer, transaction()
backend/app/infrastructure/queue/  ARQ Redis pool factory; the only place TLS is decided
backend/app/infrastructure/storage/  Supabase Storage client; no singleton (ARCHITECTURE.md §3.7)
backend/app/features/publish/   GitHub App credentials, publish targets, publications (ARCHITECTURE.md §3.9)
backend/app/worker/             settings.py (WorkerSettings) + jobs.py — thin, call services
db/schema.prisma                the schema, and the only source of truth for it
db/migrations/                  reviewed, committed SQL
```

Import direction is one-way: `api` → `features` → `infrastructure` → `core`. No feature
imports another feature's `internals/` — it calls that feature's service.

**Naming:** Python `snake_case` files and functions, `PascalCase` classes, line length 100.
TypeScript `kebab-case` files, `PascalCase` components, `camelCase` functions. API routes are
plural nouns with no version prefix: `/websites`, `/websites/{id}/runs`, `/runs/{id}`.

## Commands

```bash
make help          # list every target below, with its one-line purpose
make setup         # create backend/.venv, install backend + db deps (frontend if present)
make dev           # run Supabase, Redis, the API, worker, and frontend locally
make migrate       # create a migration from schema.prisma (review the SQL, then commit it)
make migrate-apply # apply pending migrations to the local database
make test          # backend and frontend test suites
make lint          # ruff + mypy for backend, eslint + tsc for frontend, OpenAPI drift checks
make openapi       # regenerate the OpenAPI snapshot and the generated TS client types
make down          # stop the Supabase and Redis containers
make reset         # recreate the local database, reseed it, replay Prisma migrations
```

Every target gracefully skips work that isn't buildable yet — anything under `frontend/` if
that directory is absent — and says so instead of silently doing nothing. **`make dev` no
longer skips the ARQ worker**; it starts it, and fails loudly if `arq` is missing from the
virtualenv, because a dev environment with no queue consumer looks exactly like one where
nothing is happening. `make setup` first, once per checkout; see README.md "Run locally" for
the full walkthrough, prerequisites, and troubleshooting. When you add a target to the
`Makefile`, add it to this list in the same PR.

CI runs these same commands, path-filtered by stack: `.github/workflows/ci-backend.yml` and
`.github/workflows/ci-frontend.yml`. Two rules follow from that. **Keep CI and the `Makefile`
running the same command** — if you change how a check is invoked in one, change the other in
the same PR, or a green laptop stops meaning a green pull request. And **the required status
checks on `main` are the `backend-ci` and `frontend-ci` gate jobs, not the jobs that do the
work** — do not move the path filter into a `paths:` trigger, which would make every
docs-only PR permanently unmergeable. README.md "CI" explains why in full.

The frontend job ends with a rendered-output smoke test (`cd frontend && npm run smoke`) that
loads the built page in headless Chrome and measures computed styles. It exists because
`tsc`, eslint and `next build` all pass on a page that renders wrong. If you change
`app/layout.tsx` or the font or colour wiring in `app/globals.css`, expect it to have an
opinion.
