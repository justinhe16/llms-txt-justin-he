# llms-text

Generate and maintain [`llms.txt`](https://llmstxt.org) files for websites. A signed-in user
registers a **website** by domain, the backend crawls it as a **run**, and each run produces an
`llms.txt` artifact describing the site in the form large language models can consume. Runs are
kept, so a website accumulates a history.

Vercel project keep their original `llms-text` hostnames — see "Infrastructure" below.

Supabase for Postgres, Auth and Storage · Prisma for schema and migrations only, asyncpg at
runtime.

[`ARCHITECTURE.md`](./ARCHITECTURE.md) is the engineering contract — layout, layering, the
authorization model, transaction boundaries, migration and deploy policy, secrets hygiene. It is
the authority on all of it, and this file does not restate it.
[`CLAUDE.md`](./CLAUDE.md) is the short list of rules that are expensive to get wrong.

## Run locally

### Prerequisites

| Tool | Version | Used for |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Python | 3.12+ | `backend/` API and worker |
| Node | 20+ | `frontend/`, and the Prisma CLI in `db/` |
| Docker | current, and **running** | local Postgres, Auth, Storage, and Redis |
| Supabase CLI | **2.111.0, pinned** | the local Supabase stack |
| Fly CLI (`flyctl`) | current | only for inspecting deploys and setting secrets |

The Supabase CLI version is pinned, not just "current": `supabase/config.toml` was written and
verified against 2.111.0, and config keys and defaults have moved between CLI releases. Install
that exact version — `brew install supabase/tap/supabase` or `npm install -g supabase@2.111.0` —
and confirm with `supabase --version`.

### Setup

```bash
make setup            # once per checkout: backend/.venv, plus backend, db and frontend deps
supabase start        # Postgres, Auth, Storage — migrations need a live database
make migrate-apply    # apply db/migrations/ to the local database
make dev              # Supabase, Redis, the API, the worker, the frontend
```

Re-run `make setup` after pulling a dependency change. Everything after it is idempotent.

`make dev` starts Supabase itself, so on every run after the first it is the only command you
need. `supabase start` is listed separately above only because `make migrate-apply` reads its
connection string from a **running** stack and therefore has to come first. Supabase owns no
migrations here — `supabase/migrations/` is deliberately empty and Prisma owns the schema
([`ARCHITECTURE.md` §6](./ARCHITECTURE.md#6-database-and-migration-policy)) — so a database that
has never seen `make migrate-apply` has no application tables.

**There is no `.env` to fill in.** `make dev` derives `DATABASE_URL`, `SUPABASE_URL`,
`SUPABASE_SECRET_KEY` and `REDIS_URL` from the running stack (`scripts/local-env.sh`) and writes
`frontend/.env.local` for you, never putting a key in a tracked file. `backend/.env.example` and
`frontend/.env.example` document every variable, mark which are REQUIRED, and are the reference
for deployed environments; copy one to `backend/.env` only to override a default such as
`LOG_LEVEL=DEBUG`. If you run `npm --prefix frontend run dev` directly instead of through
`make dev`, run `scripts/local-env.sh write-frontend-env` first or the Supabase client throws on
first use.

### What you should see

`make dev` prints this once the stack is up:

```
llms-text dev environment is up:
  App              http://localhost:3000
  API              http://127.0.0.1:8000
  API docs         http://127.0.0.1:8000/docs
  Supabase Studio  http://localhost:54323
```

Then interleaved `[api]`, `[worker]` and `[frontend]` log lines. **All three matter.** `make dev`
starts the ARQ worker and **fails loudly if `arq` is missing** from the virtualenv rather than
skipping it, because a dev environment with no queue consumer looks exactly like one where
nothing is happening: enqueued jobs sit in Redis forever and the only symptom is silence. If it
stops that way, `make setup` refreshes the virtualenv.

`Ctrl-C` stops the API, the worker and the frontend. Supabase and Redis keep running in Docker,
so local data survives between sessions — `make down` stops those too.

### Local test user

Seeded by `supabase/seed.sql` when the local database first initializes, and again on every
`make reset`:

| Field | Value |
| --- | --- |
| Email | `dev@llms-text.test` |
| Password | `devpassword123` |

Sign in with the email/password form on `/`, which renders in development builds only. That
password unlocks a Postgres container on your own machine and nothing reachable from outside it.
GitHub OAuth is configured and verified in production but deliberately disabled locally
(`supabase/config.toml`), so email/password is the only local route in.

### Everyday commands

`make help` prints this list and is the source of truth for it:

```bash
make help          # show every target with its one-line purpose
make setup         # create backend/.venv and install backend + db deps (frontend if present)
make dev           # run Supabase, Redis, the API, worker, and frontend
make migrate       # create a migration from schema.prisma (review the SQL, then commit it)
make migrate-apply # apply pending migrations to the local database
make test          # run the backend and frontend test suites
make lint          # ruff + mypy on backend/, eslint + tsc on frontend/, OpenAPI drift checks
make openapi       # regenerate the OpenAPI snapshot and the generated TS client types
make down          # stop Supabase and Redis containers
make reset         # recreate the local DB, reseed it, and replay Prisma migrations
```

`make test` runs the backend suite either way, but its database-backed tests only run when the
local Supabase stack is up; without it they skip with a message saying so, and the rest of the
suite is unaffected.

### Troubleshooting

**A port is already in use.** Supabase uses 54320–54324, Redis 6379, the API 8000, the frontend
3000. Find the holder with `lsof -nP -iTCP:<port> -sTCP:LISTEN`. For the API,
`API_PORT=8001 make dev` moves it for the session (`API_HOST` overrides the same way); the
Supabase ports are pinned in `supabase/config.toml` and should change there rather than on the
command line.

**Docker isn't running.** Every target that needs it checks for a live daemon — not just the
binary — before doing anything, and says so, rather than failing opaquely partway through.

**A stale container from a previous run.** `make down` is the clean shutdown. If something is
stuck anyway, find it with `docker ps -a`, `docker rm -f <name>`, then `make dev` again —
`supabase start` recreates whatever it needs.

**The local database is in an unknown state.** `make reset` recreates it, reseeds it, and
replays every migration.

## CI

Two workflows, one per stack, in [`.github/workflows/`](./.github/workflows). Where they overlap
with the `Makefile` they run the same commands `make lint` and `make test` run, so a green laptop
and a green pull request mean the same thing — change how a check is invoked in one and change it
in the other in the same pull request. CI is path-filtered per stack: `ci-backend.yml` does the
work for `backend/**` and `db/**`, `ci-frontend.yml` for `frontend/**`.

**The required status checks on `main` are the `backend-ci` and `frontend-ci` gate jobs, not the
jobs that do the work.** Both workflows start on every pull request and the path filter lives in
a `changes` job, so the expensive jobs are *skipped* rather than never started. That indirection
is load-bearing: a `paths:` trigger stops the workflow from starting at all, a workflow that
never starts never reports a check, and a required check that never reports blocks the merge
forever — which would leave every docs-only pull request permanently unmergeable. The filter is
[`.github/scripts/changed-paths.sh`](./.github/scripts/changed-paths.sh), and it has its own test
that both workflows run before trusting it.

`main` also requires linear history, so merge with `gh pr merge <n> --squash`, never a merge
commit.

The frontend is checked at three levels, because each one passes on failures the others catch.
`tsc` and eslint prove the types and the style line up. **Vitest** covers the pure logic under
`frontend/lib/` — comparators, status mappings, provenance arithmetic, URL validation — in a
node environment with no jsdom and no React, so it stays a unit-test suite rather than drifting
into a second end-to-end one. And a **rendered-output smoke test** loads the built page in
headless Chrome and measures what the browser actually resolved, because `tsc`, eslint and
`next build` all pass on a page that renders wrong:

```bash
cd frontend && npm test                       # vitest, pure logic under lib/
cd frontend && npm run build && npm run smoke # headless Chrome, computed styles
```

`make test` runs the vitest suite alongside the backend's pytest suite; the smoke test needs a
build first and so belongs to CI and to the command above.

## Deploy policy

**[`ARCHITECTURE.md` §7](./ARCHITECTURE.md#7-deploy-policy) is the authoritative copy — read the
policy there.** A deploy rule must never exist only in the README, so nothing here is new: this
is the shape of the pipeline, for an operator looking at a failure.

Merging to `main` with green CI is the only path to production. There is no manual promotion
step, and no `fly deploy` or `vercel --prod` from a laptop. A commit touching `backend/**` or
`db/**` runs [`deploy-backend.yml`](./.github/workflows/deploy-backend.yml) as three jobs, each
gated on the one before it:

| Job | What it does | What a failure means |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `migrate` | `prisma migrate deploy`, on a GitHub runner because the backend image is Python-only | **Nothing deployed.** Old code on the old schema — a consistent state, and the safest place to fail. Fix the migration and merge again. |
| `deploy` | `flyctl deploy --remote-only` from `backend/` | **The schema has already moved**: old code on the new schema. Survivable because migrations here are additive, but not a resting place. Fix forward. |
| `smoke` | `curl`s `/health` and reads the **body** — `db` must be `"ok"`, an unhealthy `redis` only warns | The new code is live but cannot reach Postgres. `fly logs --app llms-text-justin-he`. |

The `worker` process has no health check, because it has no HTTP listener — so a worker that dies
on startup is quiet and nothing goes red. After any change to its configuration, look:
`fly logs --app llms-text-justin-he --process worker`.

Vercel builds and deploys `frontend/` from its own git integration, outside this pipeline.

### Rolling back

**Code rolls back; migrations do not.** Revert the commit on `main` and let the pipeline deploy
the revert. Redeploying the previous image is break-glass — it buys availability while you
prepare that revert, and it is the only acknowledged exception to "never deploy by hand":

```bash
fly releases --app llms-text-justin-he                        # find the previous image
fly deploy --image <previous-image> --app llms-text-justin-he
fly scale count app=1 worker=1 --app llms-text-justin-he      # if a process group has no machines
```

It works only because [§6.3](./ARCHITECTURE.md#63-prohibitions) requires every migration to be
survivable by the release before it. Break that rule and the break-glass option is gone precisely
when you need it, because the old image would query columns that no longer exist.

## Infrastructure

One production environment, no staging. Everything below is provisioned.

| Service | Resource | Purpose |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Supabase | `iulfhmykutevtrgcaiec` · us-west-1 | Postgres, GitHub OAuth, private `crawl-payloads` bucket |
| Upstash | `llms-txt-prod` · us-west-1 | Redis backing the ARQ job queue |
| Fly.io | `llms-text-justin-he` · org `personal` | FastAPI API + ARQ worker, one image, two process groups |
| Vercel | `llms-text-justin-he` · scope `justinhe16s-projects` | Next.js frontend, root directory `frontend/` |

### Where each credential lives

No credential is stored in this repo, and none belongs in a pull request, an issue, a review
comment, or a log line ([`ARCHITECTURE.md` §9](./ARCHITECTURE.md#9-secrets-hygiene)). Each lives
in exactly one place:

| Name | Stored in | Where it comes from |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `DATABASE_URL` | Fly secrets | Supabase → Settings → Database → **Session pooler** |
| `REDIS_URL` | Fly secrets | `upstash redis get --db-id <id>` |
| `SUPABASE_URL` | Fly secrets, Vercel env | Supabase → Settings → API → Project URL |
| `SUPABASE_SECRET_KEY` | Fly secrets | Supabase → Settings → API → secret key |
| `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` | Fly secrets | Anthropic Console → API keys. Required **only** when `CRAWL_ENRICH_WITH_LLM` is on; leave it unset otherwise |
| `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY` | Vercel env | Supabase → Settings → API → publishable key |
| `API_URL` | Vercel env | `https://llms-text-justin-he.fly.dev` — server-only, never `NEXT_PUBLIC_` |
| `FLY_API_TOKEN` | GitHub Actions secrets | `fly tokens create deploy -a llms-text-justin-he`, scoped to this app alone |
| `DIRECT_DATABASE_URL` | GitHub Actions secrets | The same string as `DATABASE_URL` |

`CRAWL_ENRICH_WITH_LLM` defaults off, and neither it nor `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` is set in CI or in
production today. With it off, nothing in the worker constructs an Anthropic client and every
run's `llms.txt` carries extraction's own titles and descriptions, unchanged from before PER-180
landed. Turning it on requires setting BOTH: the key alone does nothing (`CrawlService` never
reads it unless the flag is on), and the flag alone refuses to boot
(`Settings.validate_required_secrets` demands the key the moment the flag is `true`).

### Rotating

- **Supabase keys** — regenerate in the dashboard, then update Fly secrets and Vercel env
- **Redis** — `upstash redis reset-password --db-id <id>`, then re-set `REDIS_URL`
- **Fly token** — `fly tokens revoke <id>`, re-create, `gh secret set FLY_API_TOKEN`
- **Anthropic key** — revoke in the console, create a replacement, `fly secrets set`

Pipe the value straight through so it never lands in a file or your shell history:

```bash
upstash redis get --db-id <id> \
  | jq -r '"rediss://default:\(.password)@\(.endpoint):\(.port)"' \
  | xargs -I{} fly secrets set REDIS_URL={} --app llms-text-justin-he
```

### The `crawl-payloads` bucket

A completed run's gzip-compressed JSONL payload is uploaded to a private Supabase Storage bucket
named `crawl-payloads`. Locally, `supabase/config.toml` declares it, so `make dev` provisions it
automatically and there is nothing to do on a fresh checkout.

**In production it is not provisioned by anything automated.** Nothing in CI and nothing in the
deploy pipeline creates it, so it is a manual bootstrap step, once, on a new Supabase project:
dashboard → Storage → New bucket → name it `crawl-payloads` → **Public: off**. Until that bucket
exists, every run fails its upload and ends `failed` with a sanitized error — so verify the
bucket exists before assuming a failed run is a code problem.

Known debt: deleting a website does not delete its Storage objects. `runs` rows cascade from
`websites`, but nothing sweeps the corresponding `{website_id}/` prefix in the bucket.
`ARCHITECTURE.md` §11 records the two candidate fixes; neither is built.

### Three things that will trip you up

1. **Use the Supabase session pooler on port 5432.** Not the direct connection (IPv6-only, so
   GitHub runners cannot reach it) and not port 6543 (transaction mode breaks asyncpg's prepared
   statements).
2. **The Vercel CLI defaults to the `dori` scope on this machine.** Every `vercel` command
   touching this project needs `--scope justinhe16s-projects`, or you will modify the wrong team.
3. **Fly secrets read `Staged` until the first deploy.** Expected — they were set with `--stage`
   and the app had no machines yet. CI's first deploy applies them.

## Documentation

Three documents at the repo root; `docs/` holds assets, not documents
([`ARCHITECTURE.md` §2](./ARCHITECTURE.md#2-repo-layout)). Adding a fourth means deleting or
folding in another.

| Document | What it is |
| --- | --- |
| [`ARCHITECTURE.md`](./ARCHITECTURE.md) | The engineering contract — layout, layering, authorization, transactions, migration and deploy policy, secrets hygiene, naming. It governs wherever this file and it disagree |
| [`CLAUDE.md`](./CLAUDE.md) | Rules for agents and humans working in this repo — the short list, plus a per-feature checklist |
| `README.md` | This file — what this is, how to run it, deploy policy |
